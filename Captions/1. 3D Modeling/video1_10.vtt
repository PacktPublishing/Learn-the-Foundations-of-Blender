00:00.810 --> 00:06.270
Now before we create our two top Lego piece I'd like to do a little bit of housekeeping here.

00:06.540 --> 00:14.140
What I want to do is make sure that this block is resting on the grid here as if the grid is a floor

00:14.220 --> 00:15.820
or a table top.

00:15.840 --> 00:21.450
And I also want to take the origin of the object that you can see right here and place it right down

00:21.450 --> 00:27.760
in the bottom center of the object and that will help us move and snap and stack the blocks.

00:27.990 --> 00:35.850
So to move this up to the grid I want to go to one of my orthographic views I'm going to press the one

00:35.850 --> 00:43.510
key on the numpad and there we go and then I'll press the five key to go to orthographic view.

00:43.860 --> 00:51.750
And what I want to do is just drag this up and tell it sits right on the grid right there.

00:51.760 --> 00:58.840
Now I'm gonna use the middle mouse button to tumble out of that and then I'll press the five key to

00:58.840 --> 01:02.260
go back to perspective mode.

01:02.270 --> 01:07.470
Now what I want to do is make sure that this 3-D cursor is in the center of the grid.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.980
It looks like it is.

01:09.020 --> 01:12.030
I want to press the Z key to go to wireframe.

01:12.030 --> 01:15.060
Just take a look at it and you can see it there.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.070
Well hit the Z key again.

01:17.530 --> 01:23.530
But just to make sure that that 3-D cursor is in the center of the grid I'm going to press shift s and

01:23.530 --> 01:29.430
I'm going to choose cursor to center from the snap menu here.

01:29.470 --> 01:33.130
Now I'm sure that that cursor is in the center of the grid.

01:33.130 --> 01:39.550
Now what I want to do is take that origin of this object and snap it to the 3D cursor.

01:39.550 --> 01:46.900
So come over here under the Tools tab and click Set origin and change the origin to the 3D cursor.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.000
And there we go.

01:49.000 --> 01:54.630
All right so now that we have that taken care of let's take a look at creating one of these two tops.

01:54.640 --> 02:01.070
So once again I'll go back to my template layer that I put way out here to keep it safe.

02:01.090 --> 02:05.410
I'll select that and I'll press shift d to duplicate it.

02:05.420 --> 02:08.140
Shift D and enter.

02:08.140 --> 02:12.970
Now over here in the outliner you can see that duplicate is called template 0 0 1.

02:12.970 --> 02:21.730
I'll change the name of that and call that two top and I'll move this I'll press the end key to bring

02:21.730 --> 02:29.470
up the moved to layer menu and I'll move it to layer number 2 cents though one top is on the first layer.

02:29.530 --> 02:30.860
Click that.

02:30.880 --> 02:35.670
And now we go over to layer Number two there is our template.

02:35.950 --> 02:40.980
So now what we need to do is create a duplicate of this.

02:40.990 --> 02:44.400
Move it to one side and then connect the vertices up.

02:44.410 --> 02:46.230
So it's all one object.

02:46.240 --> 02:46.870
So here we go.

02:46.870 --> 02:55.000
Let's press shift d to duplicate it and I'll press enter and then I want to slide this over so it's

02:55.000 --> 02:58.340
right next to the original one.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.810
Now I could try and move it over just right so they just overlap.

03:03.310 --> 03:10.780
But I think an easier way is just for me to come in here to the X location and just type in two and

03:10.780 --> 03:18.880
then we go since the scale of this plane is it 1 and its dimension is 2.

03:18.980 --> 03:23.700
I can just type in a location of two and it a line that up exactly.

03:23.720 --> 03:29.510
Now if I hit the tab key to go into edit mode I can either go into edit mode for this object or I can

03:29.510 --> 03:35.150
go into edit mode for this object but I can't really do it for both at the same time and we need to

03:35.150 --> 03:38.210
do that to be able to connect the vertices up.

03:38.450 --> 03:42.410
So what we need to do is be able to join these objects again.

03:42.410 --> 03:48.010
So to do that if you recall I'll select both of these and press control.

03:49.780 --> 03:54.400
And that will join these two together into one object.

03:54.400 --> 03:59.370
Now if I hit the tab key you can see they all go into edit mode.

03:59.410 --> 04:06.190
So now what we can do is choose these vertices and merge them together but we won't actually use the

04:06.190 --> 04:09.420
merge tool per say here let me show you what I mean.

04:09.640 --> 04:17.320
If we I'm going to kind of line this up and I'll press can troll tab to go to the next select menu and

04:17.320 --> 04:19.250
I'll choose Virtex.

04:19.270 --> 04:26.190
And now we can see the vertices here and just select these border select them with the Beaky press the

04:26.500 --> 04:33.460
key and then click and drag these right there to select all of those.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.580
But did I really select all of those.

04:35.620 --> 04:40.620
Let's go up to here and take a look at the vertices number.

04:40.660 --> 04:43.790
There's 114 vertices in this object.

04:43.990 --> 04:49.570
But look I only have five selected which means I didn't select all of them there should be 10 there.

04:49.720 --> 04:56.860
So let me hit the A key again to de-select and this time I'm going to press the Z key to go into wireframe.

04:56.860 --> 05:02.890
Now I'll press the be key to border select and border select all of these vertices again.

05:02.890 --> 05:07.000
And now this time take a look at how many I got 10.

05:07.390 --> 05:15.310
So my point is when your in solid mode and use something like the borders select tool the tool doesn't

05:15.310 --> 05:18.370
select anything behind what's in the front.

05:18.370 --> 05:27.310
So it only selects the vertices or the components in front and nothing in back of those to select overlapping

05:27.310 --> 05:30.460
components you need to go into wireframe.

05:30.460 --> 05:37.780
All right so now that I have all of those selected I can press control V for the vertex menu control

05:37.810 --> 05:38.540
the.

05:38.770 --> 05:42.190
And then I can come down here and choose remove doubles.

05:42.310 --> 05:47.920
So if I click that look at what happened it says removed five vertices.

05:47.980 --> 05:53.070
So now there are only five selected because there are only five there.

05:53.080 --> 05:58.220
Now I hit Control V to bring up the vertex menu like this.

05:58.480 --> 06:06.520
But you can also press control e to bring up the edges menu that has a lot of edge tools in it and you

06:06.520 --> 06:11.530
can also press control f to bring up the faces menu.

06:11.590 --> 06:19.420
So control the control E and control f bring up the menu and tools for those specific components.

06:19.450 --> 06:22.270
Virtex edge and face.

06:22.270 --> 06:22.750
All right.

06:22.750 --> 06:27.610
So let's hit the Z key to go back to solid mode.

06:27.760 --> 06:34.310
And now what we can do is move this object up the tab key to go to object mode.

06:34.330 --> 06:40.030
And I'm just going to drag straight up until it's about where I think it should be.

06:40.160 --> 06:42.180
I'll go with that.

06:42.180 --> 06:43.810
For now let's try that.

06:44.810 --> 06:47.730
I'll go ahead and type 2 into the Z-axis here.

06:47.740 --> 06:50.370
Let's just go with that and see how that works.

06:50.650 --> 06:56.650
And now if I tab into edit mode I'm going to hit the A key to de-select everything I'll hit control

06:56.650 --> 07:00.440
tab to go to the select menu and I'll choose edges.

07:00.760 --> 07:09.540
And this time I'll once again press alt and click to choose an edge shift alt and click to add another

07:09.540 --> 07:16.930
one and the same all the way around and we go into extrude these edges down.

07:16.940 --> 07:24.440
I'll just press e and then I'll click and I'll drag straight down down to the grid and you can see here

07:24.440 --> 07:31.610
that I'm coming back down to the grid I'm a little over negative to go ahead and type in negative 2

07:31.610 --> 07:35.400
there so I should hit the grid exactly now.

07:35.690 --> 07:44.380
And then once again I'll come down here and hit extrude or click Presti Eski to scale and scale in a

07:44.390 --> 07:54.710
bit and then off hit the click and drag straight up to finish off the bottom of the block there.

07:54.770 --> 08:01.490
Now if I turn on the subdivisions surface modifier again right over here so we can see it you can see

08:01.490 --> 08:06.530
that it's kind of gloppy it curves those edges way too much.

08:06.530 --> 08:13.130
So what I'm going to do is turn that view off again and begin inserting some edge loops with control

08:13.160 --> 08:20.210
are so control r and hover over an edge and click and then I'll drag it over here to where I want it

08:20.270 --> 08:23.530
and click and same thing all the way around

08:29.160 --> 08:31.410
and I'll add some horizontal edge loops.

08:31.410 --> 08:39.180
In fact what I can do is scroll the mouse wheel 1 time to get to edge loops and click and click again

08:39.720 --> 08:45.680
and then I'll switch to my scale tool here and just scale those up in the Z-axis.

08:45.870 --> 08:54.070
So they move up to the top and bottom edges and like that and then I can insert a few down here as well

08:54.070 --> 09:02.110
so control are same thing scroll the mouse wheel click and click again and maybe one down in here as

09:02.110 --> 09:02.690
well.

09:04.610 --> 09:05.320
All right.

09:05.630 --> 09:14.090
So now if we go back to object mode with the tab key turn our subdivision surface modifier back on there

09:14.090 --> 09:22.570
is are two top one the next video will take a look at creating one more type of Lego block and then

09:22.570 --> 09:28.710
we'll work on stacking and arranging them and will even begin adding some basic colors to them.
