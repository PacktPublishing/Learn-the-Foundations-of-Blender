WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:07.910
So I want to hide this away I want to keep this safe in a layer so we can duplicate it and use it again

00:07.910 --> 00:08.870
and again.

00:08.900 --> 00:14.390
So what I'll do is press the End key to bring up the move to layer panel.

00:14.630 --> 00:17.850
And I'll just move it to this layer way over here.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.930
So now it's way over here.

00:21.450 --> 00:26.540
Hopefully going to stay safe so we don't have to recreate this every single time.

00:26.760 --> 00:35.640
So all duplicate this with shift D and click and now I'll press him to move to layer and move it back

00:35.640 --> 00:38.630
to the first layer here.

00:38.640 --> 00:46.370
OK so now we have one here and one way down here our template This one here now.

00:46.410 --> 00:55.110
I'll change the name of this or call this one tops and this is going to be our one top Lego block.

00:55.110 --> 00:59.270
Now let's work on creating the rest of the Lego block.

00:59.400 --> 01:07.080
So I'm going to hit the N key on the keyboard to open up the properties panel and now I can see as I

01:07.080 --> 01:14.760
move this object up I can see how far moving it here in the z axis.

01:14.760 --> 01:19.860
So I'll move it up well let's just type in one.

01:19.860 --> 01:22.490
I'll just type in one and hit enter.

01:22.740 --> 01:27.300
And now we've moved it up a one unit along the z axis.

01:27.300 --> 01:30.870
Now it's kind of difficult to tell if that's going to be high enough.

01:31.080 --> 01:34.730
If we moved it up to let's see how high that was.

01:35.190 --> 01:37.780
That may be a little bit too big.

01:37.800 --> 01:42.610
Let's use one and let's work with it from here.

01:42.730 --> 01:49.750
But what we can do is we can actually bring in a reference image to Blendr and have it up on our screen

01:50.110 --> 01:51.010
while we model.

01:51.010 --> 01:53.550
To help us get the proportions correct.

01:53.620 --> 01:59.860
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to come over here to the Properties window and there's a little

01:59.890 --> 02:04.060
corner tab right here if I click on that and I drag down.

02:04.060 --> 02:14.590
I can create a brand new window and in this new window here I can change it to any type of window that

02:14.590 --> 02:24.910
blender has available so I can click here and change it from the properties panel to a 3D view or a

02:24.910 --> 02:29.240
graph editor or a U.V. image editor.

02:29.290 --> 02:36.280
This allows us to bring in images so we can see them here in blender so I click on the open button here

02:37.630 --> 02:44.680
and I'll browse to the folder where I have my reference images and if I click on this button right here

02:45.280 --> 02:51.890
I can display thumbnails for the images so click here and here you have the reference images.

02:51.970 --> 02:56.350
Select this one and click open image.

02:56.360 --> 03:03.510
So now we have a visual reference of what we're trying to create right here in our blender interface.

03:03.530 --> 03:07.900
So this is the one that I'm trying to create right here.

03:07.940 --> 03:14.690
So the question is is this tall enough and it doesn't seem like it is to me it seems like if I move

03:14.690 --> 03:21.640
it up like this or maybe even a little higher that looks a little better.

03:21.640 --> 03:28.230
So what I can do is actually type a 1.5 here into the z axis and let's go with that.

03:28.240 --> 03:33.600
Let's see if this works I'll press the tab key to go into edit mode.

03:33.730 --> 03:39.400
And now what we want to do is we want to use our extrude tool but this time we're not going to extrude

03:39.520 --> 03:40.620
faces.

03:40.780 --> 03:42.520
We're going to extrude edges.

03:42.550 --> 03:50.950
So if you select an edge of course you can then press shift select to add to that selection or what

03:50.950 --> 03:58.600
you can do is you can also hover over an edge press the alt key and click and that will select an entire

03:58.660 --> 03:59.720
edge.

04:00.040 --> 04:07.300
So I can tumble around here and hold the shift key and then Allt and click and that will now select

04:07.300 --> 04:12.120
this entire edge and I can do the same thing for these as well.

04:12.130 --> 04:14.810
Shift alt click shift alt.

04:14.890 --> 04:15.850
Click.

04:15.880 --> 04:21.400
So now we've selected the edges around our one top template here.

04:21.400 --> 04:28.450
I'll now press the e key and I'll immediately hit the enter key and what that did.

04:28.450 --> 04:30.230
Is it extruded those edges.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.680
But it didn't move them at all.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.820
Now what I can do is come to my move.

04:34.840 --> 04:43.270
Manipulator here and click and drag down and now we're creating all new faces based on the edges that

04:43.270 --> 04:44.240
we selected.

04:45.160 --> 04:53.640
So I'm going to come right down here to the grid floor and it still doesn't look like that's tall enough

04:53.640 --> 04:54.070
here.

04:54.150 --> 04:58.210
Does it mean to go out and move it all the way down.

04:59.850 --> 05:04.710
To negative to and that's looking a little bit better.

05:04.770 --> 05:06.930
Maybe even a little bit farther like that.

05:07.950 --> 05:14.940
I'm just trying to get the scale and proportion to match the image now so that the bottom isn't left

05:15.030 --> 05:17.380
just unfinished here.

05:17.400 --> 05:22.010
I think what I'll do is I'll hit the key one more time to extrude these edges.

05:22.050 --> 05:29.280
Let me and then I'll hit the enter key and now what I'll do is I'll press the s key and then I'll move

05:29.430 --> 05:36.720
the mouse and scale these in just a little bit like that to create kind of an edge or a lip there at

05:36.720 --> 05:44.160
the bottom of the block and then I think all I need to do is just hit me and click or press the enter

05:44.160 --> 05:50.820
key and then I'm going to drag up like that just to kind of close it off up there.

05:50.850 --> 05:57.630
I don't think we'll ever be seeing all the way up into the block but that at least gives us some geometry

05:57.630 --> 05:59.300
here at the bottom.

05:59.300 --> 06:03.050
All right so there is our Lego block.

06:03.180 --> 06:06.060
Now it's a little well blocky.

06:06.150 --> 06:12.330
It would be nice if we could get these slightly curved edges the way you see them here.

06:12.360 --> 06:16.860
Nothing in the real world is exactly 90 degrees sharp.

06:17.070 --> 06:23.460
You can see the way that these slightly curved edges kind of catch the light and that really helps provide

06:23.790 --> 06:31.470
more realism to our objects so what we can do is add a subdivision surface modifier to them and that

06:31.470 --> 06:36.670
will help smooth out and round out the edges of the object.

06:36.690 --> 06:43.290
So what I'll do is come down to our existing subdivision surface modifier and turn it on so we can see

06:43.290 --> 06:44.490
it in the viewport.

06:45.270 --> 06:46.800
And there it is.

06:46.950 --> 06:52.390
Now we need to add more edge loops to hold those edges a little bit sharper.

06:52.680 --> 06:59.700
So once again I'm going to turn off the subdivision surface modifier for a moment and I'll begin adding

06:59.700 --> 07:05.670
some edge loops around these edges to hold them a little tighter so to do that I'll press control our

07:06.700 --> 07:18.200
and I'll place one here and control are in place one here and I'll just do the same thing around the

07:18.250 --> 07:18.930
edges.

07:21.690 --> 07:25.450
Here and one here

07:28.680 --> 07:41.020
I'll also place an edge up here and control our and click and drag down to the bottom and click here.

07:41.960 --> 07:43.420
Let's see how that works.

07:43.490 --> 07:45.880
I'll turn on the modifier again.

07:46.980 --> 07:48.070
And there we go.

07:48.080 --> 07:55.620
And hit the tab key and you can see I'm beginning to get these rounded edges that allow us to catch

07:55.620 --> 08:00.270
the light of the scene making it a little bit more realistic.

08:00.270 --> 08:03.320
All right so I'll tab back into edit mode.

08:03.540 --> 08:10.840
Turn off the modifier for a moment and then I'll add a few more edge loops down here at the bottom.

08:11.220 --> 08:12.820
So control are.

08:12.960 --> 08:19.860
And now that I have an edge placed here what I can do is I can scroll the mouse We'll just roll the

08:19.860 --> 08:24.090
mouse wheel and you can see as I do it adds edge loops.

08:24.090 --> 08:29.520
So I just scroll the mouse wheel so I get two edges here and click and click again.

08:30.490 --> 08:38.550
And then I'll add an edge loop up in here like that let's see how that works.

08:38.740 --> 08:42.160
Turn on the modifier hit the tab key.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.680
And then we go it's looking pretty good.

08:46.800 --> 08:55.110
Now in the next video we'll take a look at using our template to create a two top Lego with two tabs

08:55.110 --> 08:57.050
on top just like this one.
