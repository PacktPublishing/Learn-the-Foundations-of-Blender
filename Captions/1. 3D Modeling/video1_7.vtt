00:00.910 --> 00:04.690
So now let's create the cross-bars behind here.

00:04.870 --> 00:12.820
I'll create a cube with the cube button in the create tab and for this I would just like to scale it

00:13.150 --> 00:14.090
or stretch it.

00:14.110 --> 00:18.910
So it lines up with the length of our pickets here.

00:18.910 --> 00:25.750
So what I'm going to do is use one of my orthographic views I'll press the three key on the number pad

00:25.780 --> 00:30.270
and that takes me to the right view and that's not the one I want.

00:30.270 --> 00:31.830
How about the one key.

00:32.110 --> 00:38.070
And we go that takes us to the front view and then I'll hit the five key and that will take us into

00:38.080 --> 00:39.750
orthographic view.

00:39.760 --> 00:47.370
Now I can slide this over go to the scale tool and begin just scaling this out until it's about the

00:47.370 --> 00:51.420
right width something like that.

00:51.420 --> 00:55.060
Now if I tumble around like this I can see it.

00:55.110 --> 01:01.150
Notice that even though I'm tumbling in 3D view here I'm still in the orthographic view.

01:01.320 --> 01:05.770
I need to press the five key to get back to perspective.

01:07.240 --> 01:13.180
So if this is going to be the horizontal brace at the back of the picket fence it's a little bit thick.

01:13.180 --> 01:16.030
Now what I need to do is scale it.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.220
But the problem is is fine.

01:17.260 --> 01:23.260
If I just hit the s key and scale it down like that it would scale in all the axes I'm going to press

01:23.260 --> 01:32.500
the right mouse button to get out of that what I want to do is scale in the Y and Z and keep the x axis

01:32.500 --> 01:36.700
the same so it maintains the width to do that.

01:36.700 --> 01:44.020
I can press the shift key and click on the access that I do not want to scale and drag.

01:44.050 --> 01:56.260
Now I can scale in the Y and Z without scaling in the X so I'll make it about like that and I'll also

01:56.260 --> 01:57.550
scale it now in the Y.

01:57.550 --> 02:09.040
So it's a little bit flatter like that every go so I'll go to the move tool and let's put that in place.

02:09.230 --> 02:16.280
Now I think I want this side to be the front so I'll move it to the back and move it up into place

02:21.660 --> 02:23.820
and we go.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.140
So now I can take that and duplicate it.

02:27.140 --> 02:34.670
Shift the click and drag up with my move manipulator.

02:35.020 --> 02:36.030
And there we go.

02:36.280 --> 02:40.740
So now we have a picket fence with our two horizontal braces.

02:40.810 --> 02:48.670
The last thing I need is a post here that will go between each of the fence segments.

02:48.670 --> 02:53.590
Now I'd like to create this object in the center of the grid because I think it's more convenient and

02:53.590 --> 02:55.770
easier to work with if I do.

02:55.840 --> 03:04.920
So I'm going to select this whole piece to select these by chefs selecting them and I'm going to combine

03:04.920 --> 03:10.950
them all into one object so I can move it aside so to combine or join objects together I'm going to

03:10.950 --> 03:12.600
press control J.

03:13.080 --> 03:14.710
And there we go.

03:14.730 --> 03:20.180
Now I'll just take that one object and move it to the side here.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.480
I'll de-select it with the key.

03:22.560 --> 03:25.270
And now let's create another cube here.

03:25.620 --> 03:30.300
And for this I think I'm going to scale it down so it's a little bit smaller.

03:30.510 --> 03:35.470
Something like that I'll move it up to sit on the grid here.

03:37.330 --> 03:43.060
And now I want to take this and raise it up so it's a little bit taller than the fence segment.

03:43.060 --> 03:45.880
We've already created to do that.

03:45.880 --> 03:53.410
I'm just going to go into edit mode by hitting the tab key all press control tab and select face and

03:53.410 --> 04:04.780
then I'll just like this top face and drag it straight up something like that so this will be our post

04:04.810 --> 04:07.980
that the fence will connect to.

04:08.120 --> 04:11.070
Maybe I want it to be about this tall here.

04:11.380 --> 04:14.140
All right I'll tab back into object mode.

04:14.230 --> 04:19.000
I'll take this fence segment and bring it over so it's a little bit tighter against that.

04:19.270 --> 04:24.980
And the last thing I want to do is create a couple of little ornamental pieces on the top here.

04:25.200 --> 04:29.000
Something to click on the cube button in the create tab.

04:29.320 --> 04:37.820
Move that up and I'm going to frame it up with the period key on the numpad and then I think what I

04:37.820 --> 04:40.640
want to do is scale it.

04:40.850 --> 04:42.050
So it's a little bit flatter

04:45.850 --> 04:47.830
maybe scale it up so it's a little bit bigger

04:52.180 --> 04:59.110
and for this I'm just going to tab into Edit Mode go to face mode select that face and I'm just going

04:59.110 --> 05:04.670
to scale this down like this just a little ornamental piece that's all.

05:04.750 --> 05:13.630
And then I'll just duplicate this shifty and click switch to my move manipulator and move this up and

05:13.630 --> 05:19.450
then scale this down a bit like this just place that all on the top.

05:19.450 --> 05:24.470
So there we go it's just a little ornamental piece and move that down.

05:24.550 --> 05:29.700
So it sits right there.

05:29.860 --> 05:31.330
All right.

05:31.330 --> 05:39.460
So since I've got some beveling on these I think I better make a few bevels on this one as well.

05:40.270 --> 05:41.350
All selected.

05:41.440 --> 05:47.020
And once again I'll press the end key to bring up the properties panel and I'll make sure that my scale

05:47.020 --> 05:48.510
is all uniform.

05:48.580 --> 05:56.890
So I press control a and click scale and now come into edit mode with the tab key press control tab

05:56.890 --> 05:58.260
and go to edge.

05:58.300 --> 06:08.210
Now just select these edges all the way around and then press control and bevel and maybe if I give

06:08.210 --> 06:10.250
it just a little bit like that

06:13.340 --> 06:20.010
and let's see about these pieces as well they should probably be all one object so I'll select both

06:20.010 --> 06:23.890
of them and press control J.

06:24.060 --> 06:33.370
And now I'll apply the scale again control a and if I tap into edit mode I can select the edges I'd

06:33.370 --> 06:36.800
like to bevel an.

06:37.090 --> 06:39.730
Really it's just about all of them I think.

06:39.730 --> 06:40.810
Let me try.

06:40.970 --> 06:48.570
Just select all of the edges and then press control me and devil and let's see what happens.

06:49.330 --> 06:49.710
Yeah.

06:49.750 --> 06:51.130
Why not.

06:51.130 --> 06:52.310
There we go.

06:52.360 --> 07:00.970
Now we have it all bevelled all right we have a picket fence segment here so I'll press the end key

07:00.970 --> 07:07.960
to get out of the properties panel and what I'd like to do is combine all of these objects into one.

07:07.960 --> 07:11.970
So I want to press the A key to select everything press control.

07:12.030 --> 07:14.580
Jay and there we are.

07:14.590 --> 07:20.000
I'll call this fence segment one.

07:20.640 --> 07:29.940
Now before I begin using the array modifier to duplicate this I'd like to take this pivot point and

07:30.030 --> 07:34.680
move it right down to the bottom of that post.

07:34.680 --> 07:41.730
Currently the 3D cursor is just about where I want that pivot point to be so I'll go ahead and snap

07:41.730 --> 07:43.260
it to the 3D cursor.

07:43.350 --> 07:50.560
I'll come over here to the tools tab go to set origin and I want to set the origin to the 3D cursor

07:51.410 --> 07:52.300
and there it is.

07:53.500 --> 08:03.700
So now what we can do is use the array modifier once again to begin creating a fence around say a yard

08:03.700 --> 08:04.620
or something.

08:04.690 --> 08:12.230
So I click add a modifier click array and there we have our new fence segment.

08:12.370 --> 08:18.130
And what I can do is just begin increasing the count and there it goes.

08:18.660 --> 08:25.820
So I create maybe four of these now to create the rest of our little yard here.

08:25.820 --> 08:32.060
I'm going to go to the top view by pressing the seven key on the number pad and then I'm going press

08:32.060 --> 08:37.630
the five key and that'll take us to the orthographic view for the top camera.

08:38.030 --> 08:44.310
And what I want to do is I'm going to duplicate this whole piece by using shifty and then I'm going

08:44.310 --> 08:52.320
to right click to put it back to where it originally was and I'm going to drag this out to the end of

08:52.320 --> 08:55.140
my original fence segment.

08:55.140 --> 09:03.030
Now I want to rotate this 90 degrees so what I can do is I can press R and I can tell it I want to rotate

09:03.030 --> 09:08.130
around the z axis and I want it to rotate 90 degrees.

09:08.130 --> 09:10.450
And there it is.

09:10.530 --> 09:11.990
So I'll do that again.

09:12.000 --> 09:23.670
I'm going to press shift D and click drag it up here put it just at the end of this piece press R Z

09:23.840 --> 09:33.180
9 0 and click and then one more time shift d click drag to the end of this segment.

09:34.720 --> 09:41.970
RC 9 0 and enter and then we have our fence around the yard.

09:42.080 --> 09:48.980
So one of the things to remember about 3D modeling is that everything is made up every complex object

09:48.980 --> 09:53.990
is made up of basic shapes basic components.

09:54.020 --> 10:00.590
So if you can take a look at that complex object and begin to break it down to its component shapes

10:01.190 --> 10:08.830
you can then begin building each of those parts and putting together the object from its basic components.
