00:01.080 --> 00:08.520
Let's now work on the characters hand it looks to me like this is just a cylinder or even a pipe with

00:08.520 --> 00:15.020
part of it cut out and then an extrusion coming out of the back for the wrist.

00:15.030 --> 00:16.900
So let's see if we can work on that.

00:18.060 --> 00:23.730
To begin with I'm going to go to a brand new layer here and then come over to the Create tab and click

00:23.940 --> 00:25.580
cylinder.

00:25.610 --> 00:32.080
Now we don't need 32 sides on our cylinder here probably 12 will be enough.

00:32.210 --> 00:38.400
And also I want to turn off the cap Phil so I'll choose nothing.

00:38.420 --> 00:39.500
And there we go.

00:39.770 --> 00:45.530
I'm going to come over here and press the period key on the number pad to zoom in to the selected object

00:46.640 --> 00:54.320
and let's go ahead and rotate it here around the x axis and you can see it changing over here.

00:54.320 --> 00:58.340
I'll go ahead and type in 90 degrees in the rotation.

00:59.300 --> 01:02.330
And now let's scale this in.

01:02.450 --> 01:06.820
So it's about the same width as our Lego hand there.

01:07.090 --> 01:11.490
Are go to the scale manipulator and just bring it in about.

01:11.840 --> 01:15.200
It's just an estimate here about like that.

01:15.230 --> 01:15.740
All right.

01:15.800 --> 01:22.500
So now that we have that let's go ahead and delete these bottom faces to make the hole in the hand here.

01:22.700 --> 01:28.140
I'll tab into Edit Mode press control tab and choose face.

01:28.400 --> 01:36.520
And let's go ahead and choose these four faces hit the x key and delete faces.

01:36.950 --> 01:42.710
And now that we have this kind of half cylinder we need to give it some thickness.

01:42.830 --> 01:48.500
And one way to do that is a modifier called solidify right here.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.620
So let's turn that on let's add that.

01:51.620 --> 02:00.290
And here we are down here you see within the solidify modifier we have a thicknesse field let me open

02:00.290 --> 02:07.160
that up just a bit and if I click and drag on this you can see it adds thickness to our object and I'm

02:07.160 --> 02:10.210
going to go ahead and add it about like that.

02:10.250 --> 02:16.680
Maybe a little bit thicker than I think I need it simply because once we smooth it with the subdivision

02:16.680 --> 02:20.600
surface modifier it's going to get a little bit thinner.

02:20.840 --> 02:29.220
So I'll make it just a little bit thicker than I think it should be like that and if I tap into edit

02:29.220 --> 02:34.020
mode you can see that really this is still the original object.

02:34.200 --> 02:40.970
And this is just kind of a temporary preview of what's going to happen when we click apply.

02:41.240 --> 02:46.350
So I tab back into object mode and click apply.

02:46.350 --> 02:54.240
So now if we tap into edit mode you can see it's now all the same geometry it's the effect of the modifier

02:54.240 --> 02:55.680
has been applied.

02:55.680 --> 02:59.180
So OK we have our basic shape here.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.640
What we need now is the wrist.

03:02.790 --> 03:08.060
And this just looks like it's a piece extruded out of the top of the hand.

03:08.100 --> 03:14.220
So if I tab into edit mode I think what I'm going to need to do is create a couple of faces up here

03:14.460 --> 03:21.420
to extrude the wrist out of to do that let's insert a few edge loops I'll press control are and I'll

03:21.420 --> 03:26.460
scroll the mouse wheel one time and click and then click again.

03:26.460 --> 03:32.670
And now with our scale to all I'll just expand that out just a little bit to get the thickness of the

03:32.670 --> 03:33.690
wrist.

03:33.720 --> 03:34.190
All right.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.160
So we've done that.

03:35.160 --> 03:43.140
Let's go back to face mode with control tab and I'll hit the three key now and if I select these two

03:43.170 --> 03:50.260
faces and hit the e key I can extrude this up to be the wrist and I'll just extruder it up.

03:50.280 --> 03:57.000
I don't know about that far enough that we can insert it up into the arm here and I'll just click this

03:57.120 --> 04:03.050
Z-axis scale and drag down and kind of flatten that up a bit.

04:03.160 --> 04:09.170
Probably not needed since it's going to be up in the arm so that we can go ahead and do that.

04:09.250 --> 04:09.690
All right.

04:09.700 --> 04:13.420
So there we have the basic geometry of the hand.

04:13.420 --> 04:21.010
Now what let's do is once again add a subdivision surface modifier and begin adding some edges.

04:21.190 --> 04:23.700
So it doesn't collapse into a blob.

04:23.770 --> 04:24.040
All right.

04:24.040 --> 04:30.820
So let's add the subdivision surface modifier there it's kind of collapsing now I'll increase the view

04:30.820 --> 04:32.030
to two.

04:32.490 --> 04:41.860
I'll come over here to the tools tab and click smooth shading what's tab into edit mode and we can see

04:41.860 --> 04:43.490
the unsmooth cage.

04:43.540 --> 04:50.220
Now around the smooth object so we can kind of see where we need to insert our edge loops.

04:50.270 --> 04:59.880
Press Control are and I'll insert an edge loop up here and another one down here maybe to hold that

04:59.880 --> 05:01.510
edge.

05:01.680 --> 05:09.570
We could probably use some to sharpen up the edges along here like this

05:13.390 --> 05:16.980
and maybe some down here as well like this

05:22.590 --> 05:27.630
OK and let's tab out of edit mode and yeah that's looking a little better.

05:29.060 --> 05:36.290
Let's go ahead and turn on the layer where the rest of the character is I'll press shift and click this.

05:36.290 --> 05:45.120
And now we can see our hand is a little big but that's ok we can scale it down with the Eski and then

05:45.120 --> 05:49.530
switch to the move manipulator and move it over here into place.

05:51.380 --> 05:58.390
I'll press the period key on the number pad to zoom into it and let's see if we can put it into place

05:58.390 --> 06:07.290
here rotated a hair and I can just press g and move it like that.

06:10.050 --> 06:13.300
Looks like we need to rotate it a bit from this side

06:18.330 --> 06:21.720
and there we go there we have our characters hand.

06:21.720 --> 06:28.250
Now we set up the arms so that when we rotate them they rotate around this pivot point.

06:29.080 --> 06:33.070
But we need the hand to come along with it.

06:33.070 --> 06:39.760
So one way to do that is to actually combine the hand with the arm so we can select the hand shift select

06:39.760 --> 06:44.820
the arm and press control J to join the objects into one.

06:44.980 --> 06:46.710
So a press control J.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.520
And there we go.

06:48.520 --> 06:57.960
So now I can rotate the arm at that point where we need the hand over here too.

06:57.990 --> 07:00.950
And we could copy the hand and move it over and place it.

07:00.990 --> 07:07.110
I think an easy way to do this would be just a mirror or this whole object over the way we have it.

07:07.170 --> 07:12.060
So I'm going to select the arm at the x key and just delete it.

07:12.060 --> 07:20.520
And now if we take this arm move the origin to the center of the grid or where the 3D cursor is currently.

07:20.520 --> 07:26.940
Now remember that you can move the cursor to the center of the grid by pressing shift s and cursor to

07:26.970 --> 07:33.820
center and then we can come up here to set origin and origin to 3D cursor.

07:33.830 --> 07:41.350
Now we can use this to mirror around that origin point so that we can mirror the arm to the other side.

07:41.420 --> 07:50.660
But we have values over here in the rotation field and if we try and mirror the object with these random

07:50.660 --> 07:55.480
values here we're going to get some unpredictable results.

07:55.550 --> 07:58.680
So to ensure that we get the results we want.

07:58.760 --> 08:05.030
Let's go ahead and apply the rotation for this object to do that all selected in Object mode and press

08:05.030 --> 08:06.880
control a.

08:06.950 --> 08:10.820
And now we can apply the rotation to the object.

08:10.820 --> 08:11.680
And there we go.

08:11.870 --> 08:16.870
So now all of the values over here in the rotation fields are zeroes.

08:16.910 --> 08:18.030
That's going to help.

08:18.320 --> 08:23.910
So I'll come over here to add modifier mirror and there we go.

08:23.910 --> 08:31.210
There's our other arm but if we rotate it we see that there is a problem here.

08:31.570 --> 08:32.740
I'll do that.

08:32.840 --> 08:39.950
We need to do a couple of things we need to separate these pieces out to be their own objects so they

08:39.950 --> 08:43.160
can rotate around their pivot point at the shoulder.

08:43.610 --> 08:48.900
So to separate these out first of all we need to apply the mirror modifier.

08:49.110 --> 08:50.210
Let's do that.

08:50.810 --> 08:56.370
And then let's tap into edit mode and we need to select one of these and split it out.

08:56.490 --> 08:59.300
So I'll hover over this one.

08:59.300 --> 09:05.990
Press the L key to select all linked components and I'll hover over this one and press the L key as

09:05.990 --> 09:07.280
well.

09:07.280 --> 09:14.900
Now to split this out we can press the P key and that will bring up the separate menu and I'll choose

09:14.900 --> 09:18.150
to separate it by what I've selected.

09:18.170 --> 09:19.460
And there we go.

09:20.000 --> 09:27.860
So now these are two different objects so I'll make sure that this one is called arm L. and it is but

09:27.860 --> 09:29.790
this one is also called Armel.

09:29.800 --> 09:36.870
Let's change this to arm our and we'll change this one back to arm.

09:36.920 --> 09:39.880
Well there we go.

09:40.010 --> 09:45.830
Now the pivot points we need to make sure those pivot points are back at the shoulder.

09:45.830 --> 09:53.700
So to isolate this on its own we can hide all the unselected pieces by pressing shift h.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.280
So now we can tab into edit mode.

09:56.450 --> 10:05.360
Choose this point right here and press shift s and move the cursor to the selected and tab out to object

10:05.360 --> 10:09.470
mode and then move the origin to the 3D cursor.

10:09.670 --> 10:10.270
And there we go.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.380
So we have that one done.

10:12.730 --> 10:16.170
Now let's press alt h to bring everything back.

10:16.360 --> 10:28.540
Select this other arm shift h tab into edit mode select that point shift s cursor to selected back to

10:28.540 --> 10:34.740
object mode set origin origin to 3D cursor and there we go.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.580
Now I'll press alt h to bring everything back.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.670
And now these arms can move independently.

10:42.900 --> 10:51.960
Now we'll need to do that for the legs as well and also create a cylinder to fit right between the legs.

10:52.230 --> 10:54.170
But I'm going to leave those to you.

10:54.540 --> 10:56.190
I'll go ahead and work on that.

10:56.190 --> 11:02.170
And in the next video we'll take a look at adding some colors and finishing up our Lego guy.
