00:00.920 --> 00:06.890
Let's now take a look at how we might create one of these Lego arms it looks like we need to begin with

00:06.950 --> 00:08.300
a cylinder.

00:08.300 --> 00:16.470
So let's go over to the Create tab and let's just create a cylinder now once again we don't need this

00:16.470 --> 00:25.200
many sides so I'll take the vertices down to 12 and I'll make sure that the cap Phil is Triangle fan.

00:25.200 --> 00:31.530
So now let's move it up and put it in place and scale it to the right size that the s key and scale

00:31.530 --> 00:41.490
this down until it's about the right diameter and then go to the scale tool and just drag this out so

00:41.490 --> 00:47.950
we can kind of get a sense of how long it should be something like that.

00:48.110 --> 00:54.650
I'm going to go ahead and press the period key on the number pad and zoom in and let's insert an edge

00:54.650 --> 00:58.460
loop where this elbow would be.

00:58.460 --> 01:01.570
So tab into edit mode and press control are.

01:01.820 --> 01:08.360
And maybe I'll put the elbow a little bit down here it kind of looks like that the upper arm is a little

01:08.630 --> 01:15.260
longer than the lower arm so I'll put that down there and it looks like there's just a slight bend in

01:15.260 --> 01:17.260
the arm so to get that.

01:17.270 --> 01:26.120
What we could do is go into say face mode press control tab press the three key to go into face mode.

01:26.120 --> 01:33.380
I'll hit the Z key to go into wireframe and now I can hold the control key down and click and drag a

01:33.380 --> 01:37.510
lasso around the faces I want.

01:37.710 --> 01:40.010
And there I have them selected.

01:40.110 --> 01:41.850
Now hit the Z key.

01:41.940 --> 01:47.410
Go to the rotate tool and maybe I can just rotate this just a hair.

01:47.850 --> 01:51.090
And while I'm at it I'll pull it forward some as well.

01:51.090 --> 01:54.400
So I get just a little bit of a bend there.

01:54.400 --> 01:56.630
Now here's the interesting part.

01:56.850 --> 02:01.580
How are we going to get this flat piece this curved piece and this flat area.

02:01.590 --> 02:07.150
So it fits right along the torso of the character well to do that.

02:07.170 --> 02:14.340
Let's grab these faces up here so I'll press the A key to de-select the ones I had selected press the

02:14.340 --> 02:18.570
C key to enable the circle select tool.

02:18.570 --> 02:26.130
And now I can scroll the mouse wheel to change the size of the brush and then I can click and select

02:26.220 --> 02:27.340
those faces.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.860
All right click to get out of that tool.

02:30.120 --> 02:37.290
And now what we can do is go to the rotate tool and I'm just going to in global axes I'm just going

02:37.290 --> 02:44.620
to rotate this around the y axis till it's almost flat like that.

02:44.770 --> 02:47.960
That looks terrible I know but bear with me here.

02:48.220 --> 02:57.690
I'll switch back to the move manipulator and just move that over so it's line with the side of our cylinder.

02:57.700 --> 03:04.240
Now I can always hit the one key and the five key to go into orthographic mode just to make sure that

03:04.240 --> 03:08.300
this is lined up as best as I can get it.

03:08.320 --> 03:12.260
All right I'll tumble out of that and press the five key again.

03:12.640 --> 03:17.500
Now we need to get this bulge on the shoulder to do that.

03:17.500 --> 03:21.570
I'll just insert another couple of edge loops with control are.

03:21.850 --> 03:29.080
And this one click and then drag up near that shoulder area and this is going to give us edges that

03:29.080 --> 03:32.510
we can pull out for the shoulder here.

03:33.730 --> 03:42.270
So sometimes you've just got to grab some edges or some vertices and just pull them around.

03:42.280 --> 03:49.950
And that's what I'm going to do here just pull these around until I get the beginning of that shoulder.

03:49.950 --> 03:54.880
Now let's insert another edge loop here and pull it up a bit too.

03:55.240 --> 04:02.090
And now we can use maybe these four edges to pull out a little bit more like this.

04:02.260 --> 04:11.940
So I'm just using this extra geometry to have something to pull on so I can kind of arrange or or mold

04:11.940 --> 04:13.540
the arm the way I need it.

04:14.400 --> 04:17.650
All right so that's looking pretty good.

04:17.910 --> 04:24.120
What let's do is let's add a subdivision surface modifier and see how much it collapses see where we

04:24.120 --> 04:26.910
need to add some edges.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.160
So I'll come over here to the modifiers panel.

04:31.040 --> 04:35.840
And I'll click add a modifier and let's add a subdivision surface.

04:36.680 --> 04:37.800
And then we go.

04:38.030 --> 04:40.280
I'm going to increase the used to.

04:40.700 --> 04:46.850
And I'll also come over here to the Tools panel tab out of edit mode.

04:46.850 --> 04:51.350
So I have access to this smooth shading and I'll click this here.

04:51.410 --> 04:51.710
All right.

04:51.710 --> 04:54.960
So let's go back into edit mode with the tab key.

04:55.400 --> 05:02.870
And now with our cage still visible Let's go ahead and see what we can do by adding some edge loops

05:02.870 --> 05:04.100
here.

05:04.100 --> 05:10.900
So for this all press control are and click and drag down to get that edge a little tighter.

05:12.100 --> 05:18.360
I'd like this elbow to be a little tighter as well so maybe control our insert in Edge loop here.

05:19.150 --> 05:23.740
And maybe one up here as well get that edge a little bit tighter.

05:25.490 --> 05:33.570
Let's take a look at our edge up here I might just take this edge and move it back a little bit.

05:33.590 --> 05:34.460
Let's try that.

05:34.460 --> 05:42.080
I'll also press shift and click of this one and just move these this way just a hair to spread those

05:42.080 --> 05:44.390
out a bit.

05:44.510 --> 05:53.010
And now I'll press control are and insert and loop up here and that's still not tight enough I don't

05:53.010 --> 05:55.190
think it's still not quite what we want.

05:55.230 --> 06:02.580
So what we could do is we could insert an edge loop up here but recall that we can't insert a loop through

06:02.850 --> 06:05.930
a triangle through anything but a quad.

06:06.000 --> 06:15.840
So to do that let's go back to face mode and with our c key our circle select tool click and drag these

06:15.960 --> 06:17.330
faces.

06:17.880 --> 06:27.240
And now let's hit the e key and click and the esky and scale those in and what we've done is effectively

06:27.330 --> 06:34.100
inserted an edge loop in triangles and that tightens up that edge a little better.

06:35.150 --> 06:42.910
All right so all tab out of that mode and here is the beginnings of our arm what we can do now is we

06:42.910 --> 06:48.380
can take this arm and move it over to our character.

06:48.490 --> 06:53.850
We can drag this over and move it down a bit.

06:54.070 --> 07:00.370
It looks like it's a little too long and that's OK for now but we can always do is tab into edit mode

07:00.400 --> 07:02.740
and go into wireframe.

07:03.370 --> 07:11.500
And then what we can do is just press the key for border select drag select the bottom of our arm maybe

07:11.500 --> 07:12.950
just move that up a bit.

07:13.810 --> 07:15.300
We can try that.

07:15.360 --> 07:19.020
I'll hit the Z key again and tab.

07:19.470 --> 07:26.730
Now let's see if we can get this placed on the arm and we can always come in here and go to the rotate

07:26.730 --> 07:34.670
tool and rotate this so it lines up with the arm here like so maybe move it out of here.

07:34.860 --> 07:36.240
Something like that.

07:38.810 --> 07:44.520
Now what I'd like to be able to do is rotate this arm at the shoulder.

07:44.750 --> 07:52.280
But right now if I go to the rotate tool you can see it's going to rotate at the elbow and we don't

07:52.280 --> 07:53.360
want that.

07:53.360 --> 07:59.540
So one thing we can do is move the pivot point up to the center of the shoulder and then the arm can

07:59.540 --> 08:01.340
rotate around that point.

08:01.790 --> 08:10.940
So let me just move this out again I'll just press g and X and drag it out and the x axis and then in

08:10.940 --> 08:19.350
the here I'll tab into edit mode and I'll press control tab and the one key to go to vertex mode.

08:19.760 --> 08:27.320
And if I select that point right there I can snap the cursor to that point by pressing shift s and cursor

08:27.320 --> 08:28.810
to selected.

08:29.120 --> 08:34.820
And now if I tab back into object mode I can move this pivot point to the cursor.

08:34.820 --> 08:41.900
So now all under the Tools tab select set origin and origin 2 3D cursor.

08:41.960 --> 08:42.840
And there we go.

08:43.640 --> 08:46.210
Now we can move this back into place

08:48.850 --> 08:55.520
and when we hit the rotate manipulator we can rotate our arm around that point.

08:55.540 --> 08:57.190
All right so we have one arm.

08:57.190 --> 09:01.000
Now how do we get this arm over to the other side.

09:01.450 --> 09:07.930
Now to mirror this over I'm going to have to undo what I just did with the shoulder because we're going

09:07.930 --> 09:13.180
to have to move this pivot point into the center of the grid and then mirror the arm over along the

09:13.180 --> 09:16.950
x axis and then we can always put the pivot point back.

09:17.260 --> 09:17.590
All right.

09:17.590 --> 09:18.730
So let's try this.

09:18.730 --> 09:25.300
Now I'm going to move the pivot point down to the center by pressing shift s and moving the cursor to

09:25.330 --> 09:26.990
the center of the grid.

09:28.190 --> 09:32.140
And then I'm going to move the origin to the 3D cursor.

09:32.160 --> 09:40.530
Now before I add a mirror modifier to this I want to point out that the rotation over here has values

09:40.530 --> 09:42.340
in it other than zero.

09:42.360 --> 09:50.290
In other words these rotations are not the way they were when this object was first created at 0 0 0.

09:50.760 --> 09:56.870
And these rotations are going to be applied to the mirror when we mirror this object.

09:56.880 --> 10:05.550
So let me show you what I mean if I click the Add modifier menu and click mirror you can see that the

10:05.550 --> 10:07.580
arm is kind of way out here.

10:07.590 --> 10:12.290
We do have the x x is selected and that's correct.

10:12.480 --> 10:23.280
But because of the non uniform nature of our rotations of our transformations here the mirror isn't

10:23.280 --> 10:25.170
doing what we'd hope it would do.

10:25.170 --> 10:29.330
So let me go back and remove this mirror modifier.

10:29.610 --> 10:36.510
And with this arm selected Let's go ahead and apply the rotation of the object to do that I'm going

10:36.510 --> 10:44.130
to press control a that brings up the Apply menu and I'm going to just choose to apply the rotation.

10:44.130 --> 10:47.440
And let's see what that does click rotation.

10:47.740 --> 10:51.630
And then we go now our rotation is all zeroes.

10:51.630 --> 11:00.370
All right so now let's come over here and click add modifier mirror and notice what happened it now

11:00.370 --> 11:04.270
mirrors the way we want it to the way we would expect.

11:04.270 --> 11:10.720
All right so now quickly what let's do is let's move the pivot point back to where it needs to be so

11:10.720 --> 11:14.200
that we can rotate these arms at the shoulder to do that.

11:14.200 --> 11:19.850
We're going to need to apply the mirror modifier click apply.

11:19.940 --> 11:25.670
I then want to separate these pieces out into two separate objects.

11:25.670 --> 11:32.960
Currently it's all one object if I hit the tab key you can see we go into edit mode for both arms.

11:32.960 --> 11:36.400
I need each arm to be its own individual object.

11:36.440 --> 11:38.990
So in edit mode I can press the L key.

11:38.990 --> 11:45.320
I can hover over one of these components and press the L key and that will select all linked components

11:45.950 --> 11:50.990
and now to separate this out into its own object I'll press the peaky.

11:51.200 --> 11:57.320
And this brings up the separate menu and I'll choose to separate it by selection.

11:57.560 --> 12:00.680
So I click selection and there we go.

12:00.710 --> 12:07.130
Now we can see that if we choose this arm individually here it is.

12:07.220 --> 12:09.890
And if we choose this arm individually here it is.

12:09.890 --> 12:22.380
So I'll call this arm underscore our and I'll call this one arm underscore L for left and then we go.

12:22.380 --> 12:26.400
Now we can work individually with these objects.

12:26.580 --> 12:30.110
So now I'm going to select one of these and press shift H.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.150
And that will hide everything.

12:32.160 --> 12:42.810
But this one object Alt-Tab into edit mode select that vertex move the cursor to it with shift s and

12:42.810 --> 12:45.800
press cursor to selected.

12:46.110 --> 12:55.110
And now if I tab back into object mode I can set the origin to the 3D cursor to bring everything else

12:55.140 --> 12:55.610
back.

12:55.620 --> 13:01.780
I'm going to press alt H and I'll select the other arm press shift.

13:01.800 --> 13:02.530
H.

13:03.330 --> 13:13.590
And do the same thing over here so select that point press shift as cursor to selected TAB back into

13:13.590 --> 13:18.430
edit mode and change the origin to the 3D cursor.

13:18.430 --> 13:24.530
Now if I bring everything back again with old age I can select an arm and rotate it.

13:25.400 --> 13:30.170
Around the shoulder and there we go.

13:30.180 --> 13:36.190
So in the next video what let's do is let's work on creating one of these hands.
