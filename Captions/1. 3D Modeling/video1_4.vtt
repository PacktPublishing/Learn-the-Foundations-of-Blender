00:01.050 --> 00:05.880
All right let's bring our books back and put them on top of the table.

00:05.910 --> 00:12.190
So if I shift click of this display layer the books will come back here.

00:12.210 --> 00:16.860
Now what I'd like to do is place these books up on top of the table.

00:17.130 --> 00:24.610
I can just select these and then move them straight up to sit on the table.

00:24.620 --> 00:30.800
I can do that easy enough looks like this one book is a little bit off.

00:30.800 --> 00:35.940
I can move that up some and maybe even rotate it a bit.

00:36.170 --> 00:40.960
I'll press the our key and just rotate that.

00:41.290 --> 00:48.620
Now if your books are too large or too small you can scale them together as one object.

00:48.630 --> 00:57.220
So if I select all of these books and let's scale these objects using different settings for our pivot

00:57.220 --> 00:57.840
point.

00:58.060 --> 01:06.210
So if I scale this with the median point selected I'll hit s and scale it would scale it all around

01:06.210 --> 01:10.040
and the median point of all of those objects.

01:10.180 --> 01:17.650
But also I could change this to individual origins and scale and we'll scale them all down individually

01:18.310 --> 01:19.000
as well.

01:21.270 --> 01:27.240
Now if I chose to scale this from the 3D cursor that pivot point would go down to the 3D cursor and

01:27.240 --> 01:29.980
it would scale from there.

01:32.220 --> 01:38.580
So a couple of different options for you as you move and place the books on your table.

01:38.940 --> 01:41.640
So I'll go back to the median point here.

01:41.640 --> 01:49.620
Now another option is if I'm sure that these books are going to stay in this configuration I can combine

01:49.620 --> 01:52.490
all of these objects together into one.

01:52.590 --> 01:59.070
So to do that once again I can select all the books and press control J and that will combine them all

01:59.070 --> 02:00.530
into one object.

02:00.660 --> 02:04.610
I can then come over here and call this looks.

02:04.950 --> 02:12.360
Now if I needed to split one of these books out from the others make it an individual object again I

02:12.360 --> 02:21.150
can go into edit mode and select just one of these books by hovering over it and pressingly L key when

02:21.150 --> 02:29.220
you press the L key you're selecting the component face edge or vertex that the cursor is hovering over

02:29.670 --> 02:33.320
as well as all the other components that are linked to it.

02:33.330 --> 02:39.580
So L for linked that split this out as its own object I can press the P key.

02:39.690 --> 02:48.780
And that brings up the separate menu so I can choose to separate these things by loose parts by material

02:48.780 --> 02:50.370
or by a selection.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.880
And since I've selected a particular one I'll just choose selection.

02:54.180 --> 02:56.280
And now it's its own object.

02:56.280 --> 03:02.790
I can tab out of edit mode and select this as its own things so books so the book

03:05.580 --> 03:10.530
something like that too.

03:10.530 --> 03:16.570
Now let's take a look at actually creating a bookshelf to go in our scene to do that.

03:16.590 --> 03:19.630
I begin by going to a new layer here.

03:19.770 --> 03:26.430
So I don't have any of the existing objects in my way or go to the Create tab create a cube.

03:27.450 --> 03:35.120
And I'll begin scaling this up with the Eski and moving it up onto the grid here.

03:38.020 --> 03:46.090
Now I'll use the scale manipulator to make this a little bit narrower and maybe my book shelf needs

03:46.090 --> 03:47.260
to be a little bit taller.

03:47.260 --> 03:51.920
Let me bring back the table just to get a sense of scale here.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.540
Yeah let me make this a little bigger.

03:56.530 --> 04:07.320
I'll bring it up in the Z-axis by pressing G and then Z and moving the mouse go and what I'll do is

04:07.320 --> 04:15.240
alt tab into edit mode select a face on top and just move that up until it looks to be about the right

04:15.240 --> 04:16.320
size.

04:16.830 --> 04:19.820
And let's go like that.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.990
We can always scale it up or down.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.470
Once we're done.

04:23.600 --> 04:29.170
So tab back into object mode all de-select this layer by pressing shift and clicking it.

04:29.180 --> 04:32.340
So now we just have our bookshelf layer.

04:32.600 --> 04:40.260
So to create this bookshelf what I need is first to define the walls and the shelves of the thing.

04:40.340 --> 04:46.340
So I'll tab into edit mode and I'll press control our.

04:46.520 --> 04:54.770
And let's see I think maybe this one I'll put up near the top that'll be the top piece I'll put another

04:54.770 --> 05:02.840
one down near the bottom I'll put two edge loops vertically so I'll hover over this edge and then scroll

05:02.840 --> 05:08.160
the mouse wheel one time and that will allow me to create extra edges.

05:08.250 --> 05:12.560
I can scroll it many times insert however many I want.

05:12.560 --> 05:16.060
I just want to hear saw click click again.

05:16.280 --> 05:25.300
And now I'm going to use the scale tool to widen those out for the walls on the side and then I think

05:25.360 --> 05:35.430
I want to use control are again and create four edges here I want to create one two three four and click

05:35.460 --> 05:36.960
and click again.

05:36.960 --> 05:44.400
Now I'm going to select with the Alt key and click that edge and that selects that entire edge all the

05:44.400 --> 05:51.600
way around and then I'm going to press shift and alt and click and that selects that whole edge all

05:51.600 --> 06:00.130
the way around as well and I'll just collapse these down with a scale tool and I'll do the same thing

06:00.130 --> 06:00.770
here.

06:00.820 --> 06:05.950
Alt select shift alt select and scale those down.

06:09.610 --> 06:17.210
All right so there is the beginnings of a bookshelf and I think I want to move that edge up just a hair

06:17.230 --> 06:25.300
so I'm going to go to the move tool and move this up some like so now to create the actual shelves.

06:25.320 --> 06:34.350
I'm going to take these faces and extrude them in so I'll press control tab and choose face mode and

06:34.350 --> 06:39.810
then I'll select this phase shift select this one and shift select this one.

06:39.810 --> 06:44.780
And now I'll just press the e key for extrude and push those back.

06:45.650 --> 06:51.720
Now if I push back too far it will go through so I just want it to go right about there.

06:52.030 --> 06:52.970
And there we are.

06:53.020 --> 06:59.650
Now I compress the achy to de-select and tab to tab back into object mode.

07:00.250 --> 07:06.010
Now I can begin to arrange my scene I'm going to bring back the table with shift select this letter

07:06.040 --> 07:09.450
and shift select that letter.

07:09.730 --> 07:16.230
And now I can begin moving the bookshelf where it needs to be.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.200
Maybe it's going to be over here in this corner

07:23.660 --> 07:27.050
and I can move the table and the books

07:29.860 --> 07:33.080
and move those over say next to here.

07:35.280 --> 07:39.450
Now I've still got the camera and the point light here in the seam.

07:39.480 --> 07:48.180
I can move these or delete them either way but I can move these to a new layer down here by selecting

07:48.180 --> 07:55.100
them and then pressing the M key forward move to layer and selecting a layer for them to go on.

07:55.320 --> 07:56.220
And then they go.

07:56.220 --> 07:57.350
So they're down here now.

07:59.290 --> 08:03.060
So I bring all these back and there is the beginning of my scene.

08:03.280 --> 08:12.360
I could create a floor for this by creating a plain and then scaling it out with the ASCII.

08:12.450 --> 08:19.950
And now you're beginning to see a scene come together so I could take this book let's say and duplicate

08:19.950 --> 08:28.260
it with shift D and begin moving it over and rotating it and placing it on my shelves and then duplicating

08:28.260 --> 08:31.410
it and scaling and arranging them all here.

08:31.770 --> 08:39.420
So with nothing more than simple navigation and selection tools as well as the extrude and the loob

08:39.420 --> 08:43.920
cut and slide modeling tools we've got the beginning of a scene.

08:44.130 --> 08:50.310
It really is amazing the amount that you can do with just these simple tools but in the next video we'll

08:50.310 --> 08:57.090
begin expanding our toolset and talking about processes and techniques that can make our lives a little

08:57.090 --> 09:00.100
easier as we're creating more complex scenes.
