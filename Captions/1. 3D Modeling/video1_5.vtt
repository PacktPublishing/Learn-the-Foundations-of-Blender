00:00.520 --> 00:08.830
Since the last video I've gone ahead and fleshed out our scene a bit I've added a floor a couple of

00:08.830 --> 00:13.570
walls and I've also filled in in the bookshelves.

00:13.570 --> 00:20.770
Now one thing I want to mention is that it's a lot easier to model if your objects are in the center

00:20.770 --> 00:25.690
of the grid and they're oriented to the world axes.

00:25.690 --> 00:31.630
What I did in the last video is i moved this over and I angled it a bit just to make it look like it's

00:31.630 --> 00:34.140
in the corner of a room and that's fine.

00:34.150 --> 00:41.980
But what I should have done is gone ahead and finished modeling and duplicating and placing all the

00:41.980 --> 00:49.360
books while the bookshelf was aligned to the x axis or the Y or Z.

00:49.360 --> 00:57.580
So it's a lot easier to move things along the world axes rather than have them be angled like I did

00:57.580 --> 00:59.410
with the bookshelf here.

00:59.410 --> 01:04.780
But having said that there are a couple of organizational things I wanted to show you here what I've

01:04.780 --> 01:08.340
done is I've created just polygon planes.

01:08.470 --> 01:16.000
I just went to the Create tab and created a polygon plane and scaled it out to the floor.

01:16.170 --> 01:21.610
I then duplicated it for the wall and duplicated it again for the wall here.

01:21.610 --> 01:27.580
Now I've gone through and I've renamed all my main objects like this table.

01:27.790 --> 01:36.120
If I hover over the outliner here and press the period key on the numpad it will frame up or zoom into

01:36.160 --> 01:39.550
that particular object and I've named this table.

01:39.900 --> 01:46.330
If I select the bookshelf you can see I've named this bookshelf and the walls of course.

01:46.510 --> 01:48.810
Here is the floor.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.260
Here's the wall.

01:50.260 --> 01:52.210
And here is the other wall.

01:52.240 --> 02:01.990
Now I had named this original book book and duplicated it and therefore looks like I've got 83 or 84

02:02.200 --> 02:10.210
books here all in the bookshelves but it's kind of a mess here in the outliner you can see that they're

02:10.210 --> 02:13.370
just tons of them.

02:13.370 --> 02:17.970
And if we were to create a more complex scene this would get even worse.

02:18.020 --> 02:21.310
So how to organize these in the outliner.

02:21.740 --> 02:26.060
If you'll remember we created these objects on different layers.

02:26.150 --> 02:33.860
So here's the bookshelf and on the bookshelf layer I've also created the floor and walls.

02:34.130 --> 02:36.820
And here's the little layer for the table.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.340
And here's the one for all the books.

02:39.530 --> 02:43.310
So I have a relatively easy way to select only the books.

02:43.310 --> 02:47.620
Now I just choose the layer that they're on and select them.

02:47.810 --> 02:54.770
A good way to select a large group of objects like this is to press the be key on the keyboard for border

02:54.770 --> 02:59.870
select and then click and drag and that should select all those objects.

02:59.870 --> 03:06.050
Now what I'd like to do is to group these all into one group so it isn't filling up the outliner here

03:06.740 --> 03:07.360
to do that.

03:07.370 --> 03:15.710
I can press control G and A group has been created I can come over here to the left hand panel and call

03:15.710 --> 03:17.810
these books.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.780
Call this Books Group.

03:20.150 --> 03:27.200
OK so now that all those are in a group what is that done for us.

03:27.240 --> 03:28.680
Not a lot.

03:28.710 --> 03:30.920
All the books are still here.

03:30.930 --> 03:37.330
So my point is that grouping in Blendr may not do exactly what you think it should do.

03:37.350 --> 03:42.270
We can see our group over here in the scenes this pull down.

03:42.450 --> 03:47.890
We can change the way we view the outliner from all scenes to groups.

03:47.910 --> 03:54.330
And there's our group we can select it and select all those objects in a group but it didn't help us

03:54.990 --> 03:57.470
organize the books in the outliner.

03:57.510 --> 04:00.560
So really groups are more for selection purposes.

04:00.990 --> 04:05.270
Well that's great you say but how do I organize the outliner.

04:05.450 --> 04:14.850
Let's go over here to the Create tab and let's scroll down and create an empty an empty is just an object

04:14.880 --> 04:17.670
in the scene that has no visibility.

04:17.700 --> 04:20.910
It only has a location and that's it.

04:20.910 --> 04:25.380
So when we create this empty it will be created at the point of the 3D cursor.

04:25.500 --> 04:33.060
Let's go ahead and move that cursor back to the center of the grid by pressing shift s cursor to center

04:33.780 --> 04:38.270
and let's create the empty click that there are empty.

04:38.390 --> 04:40.390
And there it is in the outliner.

04:40.400 --> 04:47.150
So what am I to do is rename this and call it Books Group.

04:47.170 --> 04:52.080
Now I'm going to press the period on the numpad and it'll zoom to that point.

04:52.090 --> 04:57.760
So now here is a group type object that we can use in the outliner.

04:57.760 --> 05:05.290
So now how do we do this what we need to do is de-select everything with the Aiki press the Beaky drag

05:05.290 --> 05:14.040
select all the books here shift's select the books group and now press control P..

05:14.230 --> 05:19.600
And what we can do is we can parent all of those objects to that empty.

05:19.870 --> 05:25.470
And we want to go ahead and keep the transform and there we go.

05:25.500 --> 05:32.360
Now you can see very clearly that all of those book objects are printed to that empty.

05:32.370 --> 05:39.380
And what it did is it put them all underneath that books group item in the outliner.

05:39.610 --> 05:42.030
So that helped us clean up the outliner.

05:42.070 --> 05:47.500
Now one annoying thing here is all the relationship lines and that's easy to fix.

05:47.500 --> 05:55.210
I'm going to press the end key and if we scroll down to the display area we can see here in display

05:55.270 --> 05:58.770
that we've got this setting for relationship lines.

05:58.780 --> 06:00.470
Let's just uncheck that.

06:00.730 --> 06:07.290
I keep that off pretty much all the time anyway or press in to close that panel and there you have it.

06:07.300 --> 06:13.450
We've got now all of our objects here in a group we can select that group.

06:13.450 --> 06:20.290
Now we could move it around with the G key we could rotate it scale it whatever we want to do.

06:20.500 --> 06:25.450
But at least now it's a little more organized in the outliner.

06:25.450 --> 06:25.890
All right.

06:26.020 --> 06:28.600
Well let's bring back our other objects here.

06:29.480 --> 06:36.980
And even though this is a series on modeling I think it's important to be able to render something out

06:36.980 --> 06:43.940
quickly so you can just see how the models look in your scene sometimes just seeing them hear it with

06:43.940 --> 06:47.040
the gray material isn't very inspiring.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.190
So let's create a quick render of our scene.

06:50.210 --> 06:57.920
Now what I'm going to do is use the cycle's render engine so if your blender is set to the blender internal

06:58.550 --> 07:01.880
go ahead and come up here and change it to the cycle's render engine.

07:01.880 --> 07:05.440
I think it's a lot better than the blender internal.

07:05.540 --> 07:11.780
I love what they've been doing with the development of the cycle's render engine and it's a lot of fun

07:11.780 --> 07:13.340
to use.

07:13.340 --> 07:17.360
And when I say fun here's one of the fun things I think that is kind of cool.

07:17.480 --> 07:21.320
You can actually turn an object into a light.

07:21.320 --> 07:29.690
Now to render the scene we're going to need a light in the scene but we don't have to use these lamps

07:29.690 --> 07:31.220
here in the create tab.

07:31.220 --> 07:38.840
We've got a point light a sun spot himi an area light and we can talk about those later in a entire

07:38.900 --> 07:40.670
lighting series.

07:40.670 --> 07:49.640
But for now the way I think you can create a quick interesting render of your 3D models is by using

07:49.640 --> 07:56.180
a polygon plane and assigning it a material that allows it to become a light.

07:56.260 --> 07:57.020
It's kind of cool.

07:57.020 --> 07:58.370
So let's do that.

07:58.430 --> 08:01.610
I'm going to click plane here to create a Polygonum plane.

08:02.680 --> 08:08.140
And I'm going to just drag this up and move it to one side here.

08:11.940 --> 08:17.610
And I'll call this light plane so I know what it is.

08:17.620 --> 08:23.950
Now we have a land in the scene already that's way over here on this layer.

08:23.950 --> 08:31.720
I don't know if you recall we moved the lamp and the camera over here will need this camera to render

08:31.720 --> 08:36.760
our scene but we can go ahead and delete the light here quickly.

08:36.760 --> 08:44.020
If you notice when I select this light the transform manipulator is kind of at an angle because I have

08:44.020 --> 08:48.800
my transformation orientation here set to local.

08:49.090 --> 08:52.470
I can change that by just clicking that and changing it to global.

08:52.480 --> 08:56.230
And now it aligns with the world axes here.

08:56.620 --> 09:02.140
I'll just delete this by pressing the x key and clicking delete.

09:02.150 --> 09:09.320
Now if I go back to my scene here here's that Polygram I'm playing that I created I'm going to press

09:09.320 --> 09:11.270
the ESC key and scale it up a bit.

09:11.330 --> 09:15.930
So it's relatively big and I will rotate it

09:18.760 --> 09:32.190
and place it so it's shining down into my seam maybe something like this and we go now that's going

09:32.190 --> 09:34.700
to be our light to make this a light.

09:34.710 --> 09:41.220
We need to assign a material to it and then make that material and emission material so it actually

09:41.250 --> 09:43.310
emits light.

09:43.320 --> 09:49.770
So over here in the properties panel and to come over to the material area and I'm just going to click

09:49.860 --> 09:53.550
new for new material and there we go.

09:53.670 --> 10:03.120
Now it's created a material of type diffuse I'm going to change the name of this to light mission just

10:03.120 --> 10:04.860
so I know what it is.

10:05.400 --> 10:12.930
And instead of diffuse material Let's change this to emission.

10:12.960 --> 10:13.580
All right.

10:13.710 --> 10:21.250
So now what well blender has a render preview option right down here.

10:21.320 --> 10:27.910
We can change the type of viewport shading from solid or texture to rendered.

10:28.100 --> 10:30.810
Let's do that.

10:30.840 --> 10:35.880
So now you can see that this polygon plane is emitting light into the scene.

10:36.090 --> 10:39.100
And if we zoom in we can see what's happening here.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.930
We can increase the strength of the light here.

10:44.080 --> 10:48.330
Let's say we take it up to three and there we go.

10:48.820 --> 10:55.870
And now you'll begin to hear the fan in my computer kick on as blender tries to render the scene on

10:55.870 --> 10:57.810
the fly and that's fine.

10:57.810 --> 10:58.750
It shouldn't be too loud.

10:58.750 --> 11:06.800
I hope I'm going to take this light object and select it you can see I've clicked on it.

11:06.820 --> 11:12.730
You can see that highlighted over here in the outliner and I'll press the G key and just move it up.

11:12.850 --> 11:16.720
So I can rearrange where the light is coming from.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.100
Maybe I want it a little brighter.

11:18.110 --> 11:23.810
Let's see what happens if I get four.

11:23.880 --> 11:25.820
That's kind of nice.

11:25.830 --> 11:33.090
So now how do I render a single image of this what I need to do is place the camera here and remember

11:33.090 --> 11:34.270
the camera.

11:34.270 --> 11:40.420
If I shift click this layer here the camera is on this layer.

11:40.430 --> 11:46.880
I'm going to switch back to the shaded view or the solid view real quick and we can see the camera here.

11:46.970 --> 11:47.810
It's kind of tiny.

11:47.810 --> 11:52.480
We could scale it up it doesn't really matter how big or small it is.

11:53.000 --> 12:01.010
But what I'd like to do is move the camera here that we're going to render the scene from to this place

12:01.010 --> 12:07.670
here where I have the perspective camera to do that I can come over here to the view option the view

12:07.700 --> 12:17.210
menu go to align view and I can choose a line active camera to view or as you can see here control alt

12:17.330 --> 12:18.890
numpad zero.

12:19.160 --> 12:26.270
So I'll just click that and that changes the camera view to the point where I was with the perspective

12:26.270 --> 12:31.720
camera and that's fine but it's not exactly where I want it to be.

12:31.730 --> 12:36.690
I've tumbled around I've just used the middle mouse button to tumble out of that view.

12:37.100 --> 12:44.050
What I think I'll do is create two views one for the render camera and one for perspective camera.

12:44.120 --> 12:50.110
So to create an extra view I'm just going to grab this little corner part right here and drag it down

12:52.470 --> 12:55.710
and now we have two views in our interface here.

12:55.950 --> 13:02.460
We can change one of these to the camera point of view so hovering over this top one all Press Control

13:02.490 --> 13:07.410
alt and zero and there is our camera perspective.

13:07.470 --> 13:13.890
Now I can tumble around here and move around in this view while still having the camera perspective

13:13.890 --> 13:15.630
here up at the top.

13:15.660 --> 13:25.400
So what I'll do is go to my move tool and this time I want to move in the local access for change from

13:25.400 --> 13:33.860
global to local and now I can just move this camera around until I get it the way I want it to pull

13:33.860 --> 13:34.350
out.

13:36.120 --> 13:41.260
Bring it down a bit.

13:41.290 --> 13:46.900
All right so once I've got the camera placed Now what I'd like to do is actually render out an image

13:47.590 --> 13:53.660
to do that I can come over to the render camera here on the properties window.

13:54.280 --> 14:02.080
And currently I've got when I click render I have the option of having it render out in a new window

14:02.680 --> 14:06.870
or in the image editor or full screen.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.240
I like to use a new window.

14:09.410 --> 14:13.600
It pops a new window up over the interface and I kind of like that.

14:13.750 --> 14:21.440
So I'm going to choose a new window and then I'll just click render and now it's going to render out

14:22.640 --> 14:24.920
my scene.

14:24.950 --> 14:26.420
Now it's kind of grainy here.

14:26.420 --> 14:28.350
I'd like to clean that up just a bit.

14:29.290 --> 14:33.330
So I'll close this and to clean up that grain.

14:33.340 --> 14:37.760
Just a quick way to do that is to scroll down in the render panel here.

14:39.340 --> 14:50.050
And under sampling this is where I can increase the resolution or the quality of the final render this

14:50.050 --> 14:56.110
preview is when we use the render viewport shading.

14:56.350 --> 14:58.180
That's what this preview is.

14:58.450 --> 15:03.190
But for the final render Let's take this up to say 100.

15:03.340 --> 15:04.960
See how that works.

15:05.170 --> 15:09.830
So I'll scroll back up and hit render.

15:09.860 --> 15:15.830
Now it's going to take a little longer now because it has to work harder but it should clean up some

15:15.830 --> 15:17.390
of that grain.

15:17.810 --> 15:21.060
And there we have a simple render of Arsene.

15:21.110 --> 15:29.000
So in the next video we'll look at using basic objects combining them together to create more complex

15:29.030 --> 15:29.790
objects.
