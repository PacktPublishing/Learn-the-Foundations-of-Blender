00:00.750 --> 00:07.350
Now that we've created a one stop and a two top Lego block let's now work on this eight top.

00:07.440 --> 00:07.760
All right.

00:07.770 --> 00:14.220
I'm going to go back to the template layer that I have way over here and select it.

00:14.580 --> 00:21.780
And this time of press shift d click and now let's call this eight top

00:26.250 --> 00:27.750
now with this still selected.

00:27.750 --> 00:33.780
I'll press the key and move this to layer number three.

00:33.780 --> 00:34.250
All right.

00:34.260 --> 00:39.560
So let's go to Larry number three and here is the beginning of the eight top.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.360
Now we go through the same process once again.

00:42.870 --> 00:54.570
Let's press shift D and click and go to the move tool and let's make sure and move this exactly to unit

00:54.600 --> 01:01.740
in the x 2 and we go and I'll go ahead and seal these up.

01:01.790 --> 01:08.090
I'll select one shifts like the other press control J so they become all one object.

01:08.090 --> 01:10.950
I'll go into edit mode by pressing the tab key.

01:11.540 --> 01:18.360
And then I'll switch to vertex mode by pressing control tab and choosing vertex.

01:18.740 --> 01:25.510
I'll press the Z key to go to wireframe and the B key to board or select.

01:25.820 --> 01:31.750
I got an extra point in there so I'll try again I'll hit the A key to de-select B.

01:32.120 --> 01:34.210
And border select just those.

01:34.400 --> 01:39.030
And now press control V and remove doubles.

01:39.040 --> 01:39.560
There we go.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.200
It says removed five vertices.

01:42.350 --> 01:46.280
So now we have those connected.

01:46.420 --> 01:47.900
Let's do that again.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.240
Let's take this entire piece.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.480
Duplicate it.

01:52.560 --> 01:59.640
Shift D and move it to units in the Y.

01:59.770 --> 02:01.100
Now we go.

02:01.710 --> 02:03.540
So now we do the same thing.

02:03.570 --> 02:07.530
Select this piece and that piece control J.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.730
And now and we go into edit mode.

02:09.750 --> 02:16.770
We should be able to see that these pieces are these vertices are not connected.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.110
You can see that here.

02:18.180 --> 02:21.220
So I'll undo that with control or command Z.

02:21.450 --> 02:27.210
So now we need to take all of these vertices and connect them together.

02:27.210 --> 02:37.250
So once again I'll go into wireframe by hitting the Z key be for border select and click and drag.

02:37.260 --> 02:45.000
Now if you wanted to select those by just dragging a lasso around those points you can also just hold

02:45.000 --> 02:54.000
the control key down and click and drag and notice I can just create a lasso around these points like

02:54.000 --> 03:01.850
this so control click and drag will also allow you to select multiple points.

03:01.850 --> 03:07.430
All right so now that I have those I'll press control V and remove doubles.

03:07.430 --> 03:11.450
So now we have four nubs on our way to 8 here.

03:11.450 --> 03:16.300
So now all we need to do is select this piece shift d to duplicate.

03:16.310 --> 03:19.730
I'm going to hit enter and it looks like I moved it just a bit.

03:19.730 --> 03:24.380
I'm going to hit undo and make sure that this is correct.

03:24.410 --> 03:28.870
So I think I moved it just a little bit with my mouse.

03:28.880 --> 03:33.160
I could see some values up in here so I'm going to try that again.

03:33.260 --> 03:37.300
I'll press shift D and this time so I'm sure I don't move anything.

03:37.310 --> 03:39.480
I'm just going to press the enter key.

03:39.950 --> 03:42.970
Not even going to touch the mouse.

03:43.010 --> 03:50.660
Now if I move this over in the x axis you can see that I'm going to be moving at negative 4 instead

03:50.660 --> 03:52.570
of 2 or negative 2.

03:52.600 --> 03:55.470
I want to be moving at negative 4.

03:55.760 --> 03:56.570
And here we go.

03:58.410 --> 04:02.260
Select these two pieces press control J.

04:02.430 --> 04:12.360
And now let's connect them up press the tab key and this time press Z for wire frame and I'll press

04:12.360 --> 04:24.250
the control key and click and drag a lasso around all of these like this where you go and then control

04:24.250 --> 04:26.410
the and remove doubles.

04:27.540 --> 04:28.960
All right.

04:29.680 --> 04:35.300
So now we have our eight top.

04:35.300 --> 04:40.870
Now let's turn on this subdivision surface modifier and see if there's any polling or if there's any

04:40.870 --> 04:41.890
problems.

04:41.890 --> 04:47.220
I'll turn this on and it looks like it's pretty good.

04:47.250 --> 04:56.150
We would see some sort of polling or stretching if there were any vertices that weren't connected.

04:56.190 --> 05:01.680
So a good way to test that is to turn on this subdivision surface modifier.

05:01.830 --> 05:04.220
So I'll go ahead and turn that off for now.

05:05.330 --> 05:16.060
While we continue now I'm going to take this piece and move it up to units you can see here in the Z

05:16.330 --> 05:19.550
I'll type in two and enter.

05:19.700 --> 05:26.970
And now if I tab into Edit Mode press control tab and go to edge mode right here.

05:27.110 --> 05:35.520
Now I can press Alt click and select that edge and then I'll press shift alt and click this.

05:35.810 --> 05:37.570
The same with this.

05:37.940 --> 05:41.540
And over here as well.

05:41.560 --> 05:46.040
Now if I hit the e key and I'll hit the enter key.

05:46.090 --> 05:52.990
Now I can drag this down and the Z-axis and once again we're up two units high so I can just type in

05:53.320 --> 06:01.570
negative two here in the z and then down beneath here let's go ahead and finish up the edge.

06:01.570 --> 06:10.450
So we hit the and click and S and scale these in a bit and then I'll press e for extrude click and drag

06:10.450 --> 06:11.650
straight up again.

06:12.510 --> 06:14.130
And there we go.

06:14.130 --> 06:16.470
Now we have our eight top.

06:16.650 --> 06:21.900
The last thing we need to do is insert some edge loops because if we turn on the subdivision surface

06:21.930 --> 06:24.760
modifier again it'll get all gloppy.

06:24.870 --> 06:26.640
That's a technical term of course.

06:26.640 --> 06:35.740
So I'll turn the modifier off just for a minute while I do this and then I'll press control our add

06:35.740 --> 06:39.880
an edge loop around each of these corners.

06:40.070 --> 06:40.580
This

06:45.270 --> 06:48.690
to hold those edges so they don't collapse.

06:48.720 --> 06:53.780
Press Control are insert two edges horizontally.

06:53.970 --> 06:55.290
Click again.

06:55.530 --> 06:59.580
Go to the scale tool and scale those in the Z-axis

07:02.780 --> 07:10.190
And lastly down here in the bottom I'll do the same thing two edges and click and click again and then

07:10.340 --> 07:15.890
an edge down here on the inside right there.

07:15.980 --> 07:17.080
All right.

07:17.510 --> 07:23.920
So now let's turn on the subdivision surface modifier and there we have our eight top.

07:24.170 --> 07:29.450
So now we have an eight top two top one top.

07:29.450 --> 07:32.500
Now let's turn all of these layers on.

07:32.570 --> 07:35.900
And now there we can see they're overlapping.

07:35.900 --> 07:46.800
Maybe I'll take the 8 top here and go to the move tool and slide it aside and maybe I'll select that

07:47.370 --> 07:53.440
one top from the outliner here and move that to one side as well.

07:54.930 --> 08:02.730
Now if we wanted to begin building something with our Legos we would want an easy way to snap them one

08:02.730 --> 08:04.200
to another.

08:04.200 --> 08:10.170
Now we can of course take each one of these pieces and press the G key and move them and try and put

08:10.170 --> 08:12.020
them on top of each other.

08:12.180 --> 08:16.150
But it be good if we had a way to snap one to the other.

08:16.200 --> 08:22.040
So what we can do is actually move the pivot point to one of the corners.

08:22.160 --> 08:24.970
One of the bottom corners of the objects.

08:25.140 --> 08:29.600
And then use Blender's snapping tools to snap them together.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.990
So here let me show you what I mean.

08:30.990 --> 08:35.380
Let's take this origin point and move it to the corner.

08:35.400 --> 08:40.420
So what I'll do is alt tab into edit mode and I select this very corner vertex.

08:40.890 --> 08:48.990
And now I use the snap menu shift to move that cursor to the selected component so I'll just choose

08:48.990 --> 08:50.880
cursor to selected.

08:50.880 --> 08:58.980
And now if I tab back into object mode I can come over to the tools tab and select the set origin menu

08:59.010 --> 09:01.920
and choose origin to 3D cursor.

09:01.920 --> 09:09.060
So now that puts that origin point right on the corner there now we can do is come down to our snapping

09:09.060 --> 09:16.860
tools right down here turn on snapping and we couldn't change our type of snapping or the element we're

09:16.860 --> 09:26.320
going to snap to to Virtex and we can change the snap target to active.

09:26.330 --> 09:32.660
So now if I press the G key and move this piece you can see it's going to snap to one of our objects

09:32.660 --> 09:40.550
so I can snap this piece to that or maybe I can take it and snap it over here to here.

09:40.700 --> 09:43.740
And this one now I need to do the same thing.

09:43.910 --> 09:53.060
So I'll just tab into edit mode select a corner point press shift ass and move that cursor to that component

09:53.060 --> 09:55.430
to that selected point.

09:55.430 --> 09:58.760
Now I'll come over and move the origin to that 3D cursor.

09:58.760 --> 10:03.030
And now the origin is right there on the corner of that block.

10:03.050 --> 10:08.680
So now I can hit the G key and move this around and snap it up top here.

10:08.690 --> 10:16.310
So now if I wanted to build more I could just press shift D and click and now I can move this up and

10:16.430 --> 10:23.750
snap it to here and maybe shift d here and I could snap it up.

10:24.790 --> 10:32.110
Here so you can see once you turn on that snapping tool you can really begin to build and construct

10:32.140 --> 10:33.790
these a lot quicker.

10:33.790 --> 10:37.290
Now the last thing I'd like to do is just add color to these.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.710
We haven't really talked about that at all.

10:39.970 --> 10:44.220
We can add color to these in the materials panel right over here.

10:44.320 --> 10:52.350
So click this and with one of our objects selected we can create a new material so I'll just click new.

10:52.840 --> 10:58.630
And now you can see that material has been created and it's given that selected objects in a different

10:58.630 --> 11:01.460
color of gray a different shade of gray.

11:01.690 --> 11:04.120
So let's make this one red.

11:04.300 --> 11:11.320
I'll call the material red and we'll scroll down here and in the color palette we can just click that

11:11.320 --> 11:18.040
color and move our point in the color wheel down to a red and there we go.

11:18.050 --> 11:24.640
Now we don't see it change here because we're not looking at it in the material viewport shading so

11:24.640 --> 11:27.790
let's click material here and there we go.

11:27.790 --> 11:29.140
We can see it now.

11:30.270 --> 11:31.800
In the viewport.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.480
So let's give this one a color now I'll select that one.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.960
Come up here create a new material for it.

11:40.190 --> 11:46.420
I'll call this one green and let's give this one a green color as well.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.200
And here we go.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.270
Maybe a little bit darker.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.590
Let me pull this down some.

11:52.590 --> 11:54.260
So that's a little bit darker.

11:56.110 --> 12:07.720
Every go and maybe this one could be blue We'll call that material blue and we'll give it blue color

12:07.720 --> 12:10.590
over here maybe a little bit darker like that.

12:13.390 --> 12:20.640
Now if we wanted to we could even come over here to the sample button click there and sample a color

12:20.700 --> 12:22.560
right off this blue block.

12:22.980 --> 12:24.370
Maybe that's a little too dark.

12:24.390 --> 12:28.710
But anyway you can see how you can sample colors off of an image.

12:28.710 --> 12:32.160
Now maybe this one is going to be green as well.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.030
Let's select this block.

12:34.320 --> 12:40.230
And what I can do if I want this one to be green I can just come to this menu here pull that out and

12:40.230 --> 12:49.790
choose from one of my existing materials so I'll just make that one green and I'll make this one red.

12:49.910 --> 12:50.820
And there we go.

12:51.110 --> 12:53.330
We've got our Lego blocks.

12:53.690 --> 13:00.380
Well in the next video we'll talk about using the tools we've gone over so far to create something a

13:00.380 --> 13:01.810
little bit more complex.
