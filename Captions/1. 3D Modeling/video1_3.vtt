00:01.160 --> 00:04.740
Now what if I wanted to make a pile of books.

00:05.000 --> 00:10.490
Well I'm going to go ahead and drag this up so it's sitting on the grid like so I can press the three

00:10.490 --> 00:18.170
key again and the five key to look at this and see if it's sitting right on the grid or not.

00:18.200 --> 00:22.320
There we go and I'll press the five key again.

00:23.340 --> 00:30.630
Now to duplicate it I can press shift D and now I'm going to move the mouse and I can move the mouse

00:30.630 --> 00:35.900
here and then left click to confirm the operation like so.

00:37.390 --> 00:40.990
And I'll move it down so it's sitting on the book there.

00:41.120 --> 00:45.660
I can also press the R key and rotate it.

00:45.680 --> 00:52.640
Now it's rotating and kind of a strange way here I can press the Z key and now it will only rotate around

00:52.640 --> 00:55.090
the z axis.

00:55.190 --> 01:01.340
Maybe I can press shift D again and click and then drag up with the move tool.

01:02.660 --> 01:06.630
Maybe I could scale in with the S.

01:06.820 --> 01:09.300
Bring it down so it is sitting on that book.

01:12.840 --> 01:21.550
I could press R and Z and rotate it a bit and then we have the beginnings of a pile of books.

01:21.560 --> 01:28.880
Now one thing I feel I should mention right up front here is this 3D cursor the 3D cursor is a great

01:28.880 --> 01:34.440
tool it's a little different than just about any other program out there.

01:34.520 --> 01:43.810
I'm selecting the objects in the scene with my right mouse button and if I click outside of these objects

01:43.870 --> 01:52.030
with the left mouse button I'll move that little red circle around everywhere I click.

01:52.040 --> 02:01.670
Now this is the 3D cursor and it allows you to move and snap pivot points origins and objects to it.

02:01.850 --> 02:06.840
So you can snap it to an object and then snap another object to it.

02:07.040 --> 02:12.100
Or you can snap a pivot point or an origin of an object.

02:12.110 --> 02:13.900
So let me give you an example here.

02:13.940 --> 02:22.700
Let's say I was going to duplicate this book and lay it down at an angle against this pile of books.

02:23.360 --> 02:29.180
So I'm going to go ahead and select that book and press shift D and then I'm going to click and I'm

02:29.180 --> 02:31.580
going to drag this out like this.

02:31.580 --> 02:37.360
Now what I want to be able to do is rotate the book at the spine.

02:37.520 --> 02:46.850
If I rotated from this point let me switch to my rotate tool if I switch from this point that spine

02:46.850 --> 02:48.820
moves out away from the books.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.820
I'd like to keep it right there.

02:50.990 --> 02:53.570
That's where I want the spine to be.

02:53.630 --> 02:55.970
I just want it to rotate down.

02:56.180 --> 03:06.140
So what I can do is actually tab into edit mode and I'm already in face mode and I'll select that face.

03:06.260 --> 03:10.340
And now I can snap that cursor to the face so I'll press shift.

03:10.340 --> 03:18.500
As for the snap tools and then choose cursor to selected and the cursor snaps to the center of that

03:18.500 --> 03:19.680
face.

03:19.850 --> 03:23.590
Now that the cursor is there I can go back to object mode.

03:23.780 --> 03:30.950
And one of the great things about Blendr is that you can move and place the pivot point separately from

03:30.950 --> 03:32.660
the origin of the object.

03:32.810 --> 03:39.650
For many programs I'd have to move the origin of this object to there to be able to rotate around this

03:39.650 --> 03:40.440
point.

03:40.850 --> 03:48.470
But for Blendr I can come down here to the pivot point menu and change the pivot point of the object

03:48.470 --> 03:49.800
to the 3D cursor.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.360
Now see the origin is still here.

03:53.550 --> 04:00.300
That's great but the pivot point where it rotates from has moved to where the 3D cursor is.

04:00.300 --> 04:06.540
So now I can take that and I can rotate it down at this point like that.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.580
So that gives you a lot of power.

04:09.810 --> 04:16.200
A lot of control over how you scale and rotate objects.

04:16.200 --> 04:16.440
All right.

04:16.440 --> 04:21.530
So I'll go ahead and come back to this pivot point menu and change to medium point.

04:21.540 --> 04:24.160
That's the default setting.

04:24.510 --> 04:32.370
And now that I don't need that pivot point anymore I can press shift s and snap the cursor to the center

04:32.370 --> 04:34.040
of the grid.

04:34.050 --> 04:40.110
Now if your cursor is ever out here on your way out on one end of the scene or something like that you

04:40.110 --> 04:41.350
can always press shift.

04:41.350 --> 04:47.880
See and that will center the cursor and frame up everything in your scene.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.580
All right so I have a pile of books here.

04:50.970 --> 04:55.640
What I'd like to do is create a table for them to do that.

04:55.650 --> 05:02.990
I'll go ahead and begin on a new layer so I'll click right here to select a new layer.

05:03.090 --> 05:09.030
The objects in Layer 1 go away and I've got a clean new layer here.

05:09.140 --> 05:15.180
Now I can always go back to it but I'm going to work here so I don't have any objects in my way as I

05:15.180 --> 05:16.470
create the table.

05:16.620 --> 05:21.630
I'm thinking that it's going to be a little table that would go at the side of a couch or something

05:21.630 --> 05:22.500
like that.

05:22.740 --> 05:26.900
So let's come over here to the Create tab and click on cube.

05:27.390 --> 05:35.550
And what I'd like to do is scale this up so I press the s key and drag the mouse out about like this.

05:35.550 --> 05:40.230
Now this is going to be the top of the table so I'd like it to be thinner than this.

05:40.230 --> 05:42.330
So there are two ways I can do that one.

05:42.360 --> 05:50.620
I can go to the scale tool and click and drag on the z axis or another way is I can press the s key

05:51.010 --> 05:56.680
and then the Z key to control the scale to the z axis.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.390
Either one is fine.

05:58.390 --> 05:59.870
So I'll go with that.

06:00.860 --> 06:04.670
And I'll move this up to about here.

06:04.730 --> 06:06.480
So that's the top of my table.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.890
Currently I'm pivoting around the center of the grid.

06:09.890 --> 06:14.900
What I'd like to do is pivot around this table to do that.

06:14.900 --> 06:21.320
I can press the period key on the number pad and that will zoom in to the selected object and also frame

06:21.320 --> 06:21.860
it up.

06:23.090 --> 06:31.520
So now I'll tab into edit mode select the face at the bottom here and I want to drag a piece down an

06:31.760 --> 06:35.160
in set piece where the legs will fit into.

06:35.180 --> 06:44.060
So press the e key and then I'll click and then I'll press the s key and I'll scale in a bit and then

06:44.060 --> 06:51.450
once again I'll press C and I'll drag straight down with the mouse and then I'll press the and click

06:52.350 --> 07:00.520
press asked for scale and scale this in a bit and then once again I'll press the end drag straight up

07:01.450 --> 07:08.590
to insert underneath the table now if I pull too far it'll come up out of the top of the table.

07:08.590 --> 07:11.410
I just want to bring it up a little bit underneath here.

07:12.570 --> 07:16.980
And there we go there is the beginnings of our table.

07:16.980 --> 07:20.090
So now I want to put legs in the table.

07:20.240 --> 07:22.250
Alt-Tab back into object mode.

07:22.470 --> 07:31.740
And so I can stay organized I better come over here and call this table top something like that just

07:31.740 --> 07:38.440
so I can stay organized I should go back and name all of these book objects as well.

07:38.670 --> 07:45.020
But for now let's go ahead and keep working on the table to create a table leg.

07:45.090 --> 07:53.360
Use another cube and for this I think I'll scale it down just a little bit so it's not quite as thick

07:55.200 --> 08:02.900
and I'll also come over here to the scaled tool and dragged that up in the Z-axis now I need to be able

08:02.900 --> 08:06.820
to see where I'm placing these and how tall they are.

08:06.830 --> 08:17.080
One method I like is the quad view panel you can press control alt Q and see your scene from four different

08:17.080 --> 08:23.020
viewpoints so you have the standard perspective window that we've been using over here.

08:23.200 --> 08:27.600
And then you've got the right front and top cameras.

08:27.610 --> 08:33.670
Now I also like to work in wireframe when I've got the four views here so when I pressed the Z key so

08:33.670 --> 08:36.190
I can see in wireframe.

08:36.190 --> 08:42.980
Now I can see if I come over here to the move tool I can see that I can drag this up.

08:43.220 --> 08:50.300
Maybe it's still a little too tall so I'll press S and Z and scale this down a bit.

08:51.900 --> 09:01.270
I like that and I'll press the G key in the side view here and just move it to where it needs to be.

09:01.280 --> 09:06.910
Now you can see although I've moved it to the side of the table here it isn't yet in the corner.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.610
You can see it up here in the top view.

09:09.770 --> 09:17.360
So I can drag it over in the top view and line it up with one of the corners I'll hit Z again so he

09:17.360 --> 09:18.600
can see it.

09:18.860 --> 09:20.160
And there you are.

09:20.780 --> 09:23.600
I'll toggle back into wireframe with a Z key again.

09:23.620 --> 09:32.880
And now that this is in place we can just press shift D and drag over to the other corner here.

09:32.890 --> 09:41.860
Now I can shift select this one so those selected I'll press shift d to duplicate click to confirm the

09:41.860 --> 09:47.500
tool and then I'll just use the Move manipulator to drag these over to the other corners.

09:48.360 --> 09:54.640
And then we have it a table or press control alt cue again to get back to the perspective view.

09:54.810 --> 10:01.140
Press the Z key to go to shaded view again and there we have it.

10:01.180 --> 10:05.110
Now currently it's all individual pieces.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.880
I think we should combine all of these into one object.

10:09.120 --> 10:18.080
So to do that I'm going to select all the pieces with shift's select and then press control J to combine

10:18.080 --> 10:18.890
them.

10:18.890 --> 10:24.850
Now our object here is the table top still depending on the order of selection.

10:25.190 --> 10:32.030
This name may have changed so you may have to rename this back to table top but now what I'd like to

10:32.030 --> 10:34.940
do is to place this in the scene better.

10:34.940 --> 10:40.440
I'd like the pivot point to be at the bottom center of the object.

10:40.520 --> 10:47.210
And since I've been modeling my object in the center of the grid here the 3D cursor is at a perfect

10:47.210 --> 10:48.640
point to do this.

10:48.650 --> 10:54.140
So with the 3D cursor in the center of the scene and if it isn't remember you can press shift s and

10:54.140 --> 10:56.310
then cursor to center.

10:56.570 --> 11:04.040
I'm going to come over to the tools tab and click the set origin pull down menu and now I can set the

11:04.040 --> 11:07.450
origin to the 3D cursor.

11:07.590 --> 11:12.830
And now this object will move at this point.

11:13.870 --> 11:19.360
I can even rotate it all press the Archey and rotate it around that point.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.480
So I'll do this.

11:24.480 --> 11:29.740
So the 3D cursor is really handy for moving origins and moving pivot points.
