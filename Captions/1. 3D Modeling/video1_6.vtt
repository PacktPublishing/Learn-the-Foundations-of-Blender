00:00.750 --> 00:07.110
Continuing on with our introduction to modeling in Blendr series I'd like to talk a little bit about

00:07.200 --> 00:16.680
how to create more complex objects out of basic shapes just like in drawing you can build up complex

00:16.680 --> 00:23.770
objects beginning with the basic shapes of cubes cylinder cone Taurus etc..

00:24.030 --> 00:26.790
So let's look at an example of that.

00:26.850 --> 00:29.890
First of all I'm going to collapse these windows together.

00:30.080 --> 00:36.390
I'm going to right click in between the windows choose join area and you see I can move this arrow up

00:36.480 --> 00:41.770
and down I'm going to collapse this up into the top window.

00:41.910 --> 00:50.490
So I get back to this main window here I'm going to start on a brand new layer over here and with an

00:50.490 --> 00:58.230
empty scene what I'd like to do is begin working on a picket fence and a picket fence is a classic example

00:58.230 --> 01:04.740
of a relatively complex object that is built up with just multiple basic shapes.

01:04.740 --> 01:13.590
So you find in that complex object the basic shape and then duplicate it or expand upon it to create

01:13.590 --> 01:15.720
the larger object.

01:16.020 --> 01:23.880
So to create a picket fence we're going to begin with a cube and I'm going to just go to my scale tool

01:23.880 --> 01:29.850
here and scale this up a bit until we get it to be about the right size.

01:31.180 --> 01:41.640
Maybe go like this and maybe like yes I'm going to go ahead and hit the period key on the number pad

01:41.640 --> 01:46.130
to frame that up and center the tumble of rotation around that point.

01:46.500 --> 01:50.610
And so this will be my first piece of the fence.

01:50.970 --> 01:58.000
Move this up and have it sit up here on the grid.

01:58.020 --> 02:04.580
Now what I'd like to do is create a little curved piece at the top of this to do that.

02:04.590 --> 02:08.870
I'm going to insert a few edge loops so I'll tab into edit mode.

02:08.880 --> 02:12.040
I'll hit the A key to de-select everything.

02:12.410 --> 02:19.080
And now once again I'm going to use the loop cut and slide tool with control r and I'm going to hover

02:19.080 --> 02:24.580
over this edge and scroll the mouse wheel one time to get to edges.

02:24.630 --> 02:29.410
I can scroll more to get more but I think I'll just create two.

02:29.520 --> 02:33.500
So I click and then click again to confirm that.

02:33.630 --> 02:42.000
Now I'm going to press control tab to go to face mode here and select this one face and I'm just going

02:42.000 --> 02:43.440
to move up in the Z.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.940
So I'll just press g for grab and move.

02:47.190 --> 02:55.690
And then Z for the z axis and just move that up just a hair so now we have the beginnings of a picket

02:55.690 --> 02:57.810
fence I'll tab out of that.

02:57.820 --> 03:01.840
And there's our ticket now.

03:01.900 --> 03:06.890
Nothing in the real world has exactly 90 degree edges.

03:07.000 --> 03:16.570
This object here has very sharp edges and to make this a little more realistic we can curve or bevelled

03:16.570 --> 03:22.030
these edges so that they catch the light and don't look so perfectly sharp.

03:22.540 --> 03:26.150
So to do that I need to select these edges here.

03:28.370 --> 03:35.690
And now Blendr has several menus based on the component that youre working with.

03:35.690 --> 03:44.040
So if I'm working with edges I can press control E and there is a menu here for edges.

03:44.120 --> 03:54.380
I can also press control f if I wanted to get a menu for faces and I can also press control V if I want

03:54.380 --> 04:03.740
a menu for vertices but since I'm dealing with edges here I'll press control E and right here is a tool

04:03.740 --> 04:08.950
called Bevell and this will help round out those edges.

04:08.990 --> 04:15.620
However I need to point out that the tool is based on the scale of the object.

04:15.650 --> 04:21.810
So if the scale of the object is nonuniform then the Bevil will act strangely in this.

04:21.830 --> 04:24.070
Let me show you what I mean here.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.460
Some unclick bevel.

04:26.810 --> 04:33.210
And as I drag the mouse you can see that it kind of expands the edges.

04:33.350 --> 04:40.760
I can scroll the mouse wheel and add more edges in here but it's not really behaving like I'd want it

04:40.760 --> 04:41.060
to.

04:41.060 --> 04:43.120
I want it to curve the edges.

04:43.110 --> 04:50.890
It's just pulling these out in a flat kind of a way if I tumble around the side you can see that there's

04:50.930 --> 04:53.360
no curve here it's just flat.

04:53.360 --> 04:54.820
How do we fix that.

04:55.160 --> 05:02.330
Well I'm going to press control or command Z to undo this and then I'm going to come back out of edit

05:02.330 --> 05:05.080
mode by by pressing the tab key.

05:05.270 --> 05:13.130
And if I come over here to the properties panel with the End key I can see here that the scale is what

05:13.130 --> 05:15.080
they call nonuniform.

05:15.080 --> 05:21.440
In other words it's got multiple values here instead of just all ones.

05:21.440 --> 05:28.850
And this is because I use this scale tool to stretch and pull the size of this cube and tell it was

05:28.940 --> 05:31.340
the size of a picket for our picket fence.

05:31.670 --> 05:38.440
What I'd like is to have this these values be uniform so to do that in Object mode.

05:38.480 --> 05:40.700
I'm going to press control a.

05:41.030 --> 05:44.600
And that brings up this apply transforms menu.

05:44.990 --> 05:50.700
And I will just apply the scale transformations like that.

05:50.930 --> 05:57.110
And now notice the scale is all ones it's uniform.

05:57.110 --> 05:59.130
Now let's go back into edit mode.

05:59.150 --> 06:06.340
And with these edges still selected all press control E and select bevel.

06:06.440 --> 06:14.840
And now if I do this and drag the mouse out and in until I get something I like here and there we go.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.100
Just dragging the mouse out.

06:18.130 --> 06:24.610
Now you'll notice and I can add edge loops here by scrolling the mouse wheel Now you'll notice that

06:24.610 --> 06:28.480
that bevel is a little bit more like what we were after.

06:28.480 --> 06:37.690
It's rounded on the edges here and that's what I was after is a rounded edge here I'll I'll go back

06:37.690 --> 06:42.250
into object mode and you can see that it's kind of a rounded edge.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.620
So I come over here and do the same thing for the other side.

06:45.620 --> 06:59.260
So like this edge and these edges here like so and then press control the bevel and pull these out as

06:59.260 --> 07:02.220
well so.

07:02.740 --> 07:03.280
OK.

07:03.490 --> 07:09.310
So that is how to get kind of a rounded edge on your object.

07:09.310 --> 07:16.690
Now there are other ways to do this and there are some caveats of course like the scale issue we just

07:16.870 --> 07:27.400
talked about but also if I tumble way down here to the bottom of the object and go into edit mode you

07:27.400 --> 07:35.740
can see that this face right here if I click on these edges you can see that this is a polygon with

07:36.840 --> 07:39.810
quite a few sides to it.

07:40.990 --> 07:46.000
In fact I can see up here where it says Virts edges faces.

07:46.000 --> 07:53.580
I can see that I have 10 edges selected and in the object there is a total of 94.

07:53.740 --> 07:56.050
Well this 10 edges on one face.

07:56.050 --> 08:03.520
Could be a problem if I'm going to try and smooth this or if I'm going to try and sculpt this object

08:03.940 --> 08:09.550
having faces with more than four edges can be a problem.

08:09.550 --> 08:14.890
Generally speaking you want to work with quads or four sided polygons.

08:14.890 --> 08:17.080
This is a 10 sided polygon.

08:17.140 --> 08:24.430
You can also work with tries three sided polygons or in guns polygons that have more than four sides

08:24.430 --> 08:30.340
and that's what this is an Ngan now because I'm not going to try and smooth it and I'm not going to

08:30.400 --> 08:32.060
try and sculpt it.

08:32.080 --> 08:40.750
This will probably be just fine but I just wanted to warn you about this using the bevel tool can easily

08:40.750 --> 08:43.450
create in Gonz when you don't mean to.

08:43.660 --> 08:45.510
So I just wanted to point that out.

08:46.030 --> 08:54.790
And now what we need to do is create a few more a few more Picketts say maybe we want 12 Picketts in

08:54.790 --> 08:57.570
this particular fence segment.

08:57.580 --> 09:01.400
Now we've already seen how to duplicate objects with shift.

09:01.510 --> 09:05.370
So I could select this object press shift D.

09:05.500 --> 09:11.670
I'm going to click and I want to move with the move manipulator just over a bit like that.

09:12.030 --> 09:16.040
And then I could hit shift D and I could move it again.

09:16.090 --> 09:22.170
But the problem is is I'm not getting exact wits between each of these objects.

09:22.390 --> 09:28.300
If I press shift D and then click and drag again I can try and get it by but I'm not really getting

09:28.300 --> 09:32.180
the same distance between each of these.

09:32.230 --> 09:38.000
So how did duplicate objects and get that consistent distance between them.

09:38.270 --> 09:42.220
So I'm going to delete these with the x key and choose delete.

09:42.760 --> 09:49.260
So what I'm going to do is use a tool or a modifier called the array modifier.

09:49.340 --> 09:54.100
Now modifiers can be found over here under the little wrench icon.

09:54.100 --> 09:55.110
So when I click that.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.720
And here is our ADD modifiers menu.

09:57.730 --> 10:03.070
So I click that and here are all the modifiers that we can use.

10:03.070 --> 10:05.120
And here is the array here.

10:05.170 --> 10:14.200
Now each one of these will allow you to add a modifier and be able to adjust it in a nondestructive

10:14.200 --> 10:14.800
way.

10:15.160 --> 10:21.520
And then once you have the modifier settings the way you like them then you can apply them and make

10:21.520 --> 10:22.580
them permanent.

10:22.600 --> 10:26.450
So I'm going to go ahead and choose the array modifier here.

10:26.860 --> 10:34.600
And over here we have quite a few settings and things to play with not going to stretch this out a bit

10:34.600 --> 10:40.440
so we can see this now each modifier has these buttons up here.

10:40.480 --> 10:47.450
In other words this little camera means that we can see the modifier during the render right.

10:47.490 --> 10:55.330
We can turn that off and on we can see the modifier in the viewport or not.

10:55.720 --> 11:03.650
Or we can see the modifier when we're in edit mode These buttons are common to most of the modifiers.

11:03.910 --> 11:05.410
But let's take a look at this.

11:05.440 --> 11:13.420
I've got now two pickets Picketts the array modifier has created is created an array of two objects

11:13.660 --> 11:15.540
based on that original.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.600
Now I can increase the count here.

11:17.800 --> 11:19.560
So two three four five.

11:19.690 --> 11:21.210
And what I want is I want 12.

11:21.210 --> 11:24.410
So I'm just going to type in 12 and hit enter.

11:24.430 --> 11:30.400
So now I have 12 Picketts here and remember that this is nondestructive.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.900
This isn't actually happening this is kind of a preview I can turn this off.

11:34.930 --> 11:36.830
It isn't actually there.

11:37.150 --> 11:38.820
I'll turn it back on.

11:38.920 --> 11:43.090
And now I'm going to change the the offset between these.

11:43.120 --> 11:49.900
Currently it's at 1 if I just click this arrow and increase that you can see increasing the distance

11:49.900 --> 11:53.870
between each one but add an equal amount.

11:53.890 --> 12:02.470
So let's say I want my picket fence to have this much distance between each picket.

12:02.580 --> 12:09.480
So as I said when you're done adjusting the settings of the modifier you can then apply them by just

12:09.570 --> 12:13.640
clicking apply and then we have it.

12:13.640 --> 12:16.530
Now this is all one object.

12:16.760 --> 12:23.140
I can hit the tab key and see them all in edit mode at the same time.

12:23.270 --> 12:25.880
And then we have our 12 tickets.
