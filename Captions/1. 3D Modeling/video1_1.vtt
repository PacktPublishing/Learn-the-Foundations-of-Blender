00:00.920 --> 00:08.360
This is Deren Lisl and welcome to an introduction to 3D modeling in Blendr I've been teaching 3D animation

00:08.420 --> 00:14.360
at the college level for quite a few years now and I've noticed that many people complain about the

00:14.360 --> 00:20.410
complexity or the difficulty of learning Blendr or learning 3-D modeling.

00:20.510 --> 00:26.510
And oftentimes I feel that it's simply because they didn't have that kind of fundamental foundation

00:26.960 --> 00:31.840
before they took off and they started trying to model an F-16 or something like that.

00:31.880 --> 00:37.280
I think there are certain fundamental things that it's good to know and I hope to go over those in this

00:37.280 --> 00:38.330
series.

00:38.330 --> 00:44.870
So first of all if you're new to Blendr let me just quickly go over the navigation and the interface.

00:44.870 --> 00:51.540
It looks a lot more complex than it is but let's just begin with navigating in 3D space.

00:51.860 --> 00:57.470
I'm just going to use the middle mouse button and I'm going to click and drag and in doing that I can

00:57.470 --> 01:03.890
tumble around if I hold the shift key down and press the middle mouse button and click and drag I can

01:03.890 --> 01:11.120
pan and if I hold the control button down and hold the middle mouse button and move the mouse up and

01:11.120 --> 01:17.170
down like that I can zoom in and out and I can also zoom in and out with the scroll wheel.

01:17.210 --> 01:24.390
The next thing is selecting objects and by default this is done with the right mouse button.

01:24.410 --> 01:32.180
So usually with most programs you select things with the left mouse button with Blender it's the complete

01:32.180 --> 01:32.690
opposite.

01:32.690 --> 01:34.160
It's the right one.

01:34.520 --> 01:40.310
However if this seems very strange to you you can always change that by going over to the File menu

01:40.730 --> 01:50.610
coming over the user preferences and you can change the select with from right to the left mouse button.

01:50.630 --> 01:57.110
I suggest that if you're new to Blender go ahead and switch this and then click on Save user settings

01:57.620 --> 01:59.500
and then close the window here.

01:59.540 --> 02:05.810
I'm going to stick with the right because I've been doing it for years and I'm kind of old school here.

02:05.810 --> 02:12.350
Now when you first open blender you've got a default cube here on the grid you can view this cube in

02:12.350 --> 02:13.400
a couple of ways.

02:13.400 --> 02:18.490
One is if you hit the Z key on the keyboard it'll change to wireframe.

02:18.650 --> 02:22.400
And if you hit the Z key again it'll change back to shaded view.

02:22.400 --> 02:23.450
Now you can change that.

02:23.480 --> 02:32.150
Also down here as well with the viewport shading menu to move this cube around we can use the manipulator

02:32.150 --> 02:33.100
gizmo's here.

02:33.110 --> 02:36.830
The move manipulator is currently active.

02:36.830 --> 02:46.400
I can change it here to rotate and scale but I can also use the shortcut keys g to move and then click

02:46.400 --> 02:53.660
with the left mouse button I can press R and move the mouse to rotate it and then click again with the

02:53.660 --> 03:01.440
left mouse button to complete the tool or click with the right mouse button to activate it.

03:01.610 --> 03:07.310
And of course I can press the s key and scale the object in and out as well and I'll press the left

03:07.310 --> 03:10.730
mouse button to confirm the tool.

03:10.730 --> 03:17.960
Now you can also constrain the movement to a particular axis so let's say I wanted to move this object

03:18.290 --> 03:22.850
only in the y axis or this green axis here you can see the axes.

03:22.970 --> 03:28.560
Down here the x y and z x is red y as green Z is blue.

03:28.760 --> 03:35.230
But if I wanted to move this in the y axis I could just press g and then immediately hit the y axis.

03:35.330 --> 03:43.160
And now I can move it in only the y axis and I'll click to confirm it in the same way I can press the

03:43.220 --> 03:46.010
R key and press the Y key.

03:46.010 --> 03:51.240
And now I can only rotate that object around the y axis.

03:53.030 --> 03:58.250
And scaling works in much the same way say I wanted to scale this in the y axis as well so I can hit

03:58.280 --> 04:00.190
s and press Y.

04:00.350 --> 04:05.690
And now I can scale it in that axis only.

04:05.760 --> 04:13.260
Now you may find in other programs that the x y and z axis is a little bit differently configured in

04:13.260 --> 04:16.190
Blendr the z axis is the up axis.

04:16.380 --> 04:20.590
In many other programs the y axis is the axis.

04:20.730 --> 04:27.370
And that really only gets confusing if you're trying to export objects and move them to another program.

04:27.540 --> 04:33.170
If you're going to be staying in Blendr for pretty much all your three-D work it really won't matter.

04:33.180 --> 04:36.030
Now there are a couple of other shortcut keys that she should know.

04:36.120 --> 04:37.900
One is the T key.

04:37.950 --> 04:44.910
If I press the T key on the keyboard you can see that the Tools panel over here closes and opens.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.340
So that's an easy way to hide that.

04:47.340 --> 04:52.870
Another keyboard shortcut that opens up a panel is the N key on the keyboard.

04:52.980 --> 04:59.370
And if I press the end key and then open up the properties panel over here and one of the most important

04:59.400 --> 05:07.320
features of the properties panel is the transform fields here the location rotation scale and even the

05:07.320 --> 05:08.530
dimensions.

05:08.700 --> 05:15.870
So you can even input values here into these fields to move rotate and scale your object.

05:15.870 --> 05:21.240
So let's say I wanted to get the scale of the object back to the way it was when it was a cube.

05:21.510 --> 05:29.340
I can click and drag these fields here and change all of the scale fields back to one I can zero out

05:29.340 --> 05:30.370
the rotation.

05:30.390 --> 05:38.430
So I had rotated it in the y axis 0 0 0 that out here and I can take the location back to zero as well

05:38.660 --> 05:43.080
with the X Y and Z click and drag those hit the zero key and hit enter.

05:43.080 --> 05:48.420
And now my cube is back to the way it was when it was first created.

05:48.420 --> 05:54.090
Notice that even though the scale is at one the dimensions are two two and two and that refers to the

05:54.090 --> 06:00.600
grid units or the default grid units in Blendr these grid units don't really coincide with anything

06:00.600 --> 06:01.660
in the real world.

06:01.720 --> 06:06.260
However they most closely resemble meters I should say.

06:06.450 --> 06:13.930
If I come over here to this button here the scene button on the properties window you can see I've got

06:13.930 --> 06:21.530
units and right now there is none which means we're just using the Blendr default units.

06:21.700 --> 06:29.980
We can change it to metric and you can see not much changes here except meters up here and two meters

06:29.980 --> 06:36.670
here or we can change it to the imperial system of inches and feet and then you can see the grid has

06:36.670 --> 06:42.960
shrunk quite a bit and we've changed the feet here and feet and inches here.

06:42.970 --> 06:49.030
Now Actually these aren't quite inches they're just decimals but I can change this to separate units

06:49.030 --> 06:49.370
here.

06:49.390 --> 06:51.440
And now you can see it's got six feet.

06:51.460 --> 06:53.530
Six point seven inches.

06:53.590 --> 06:59.230
But generally speaking I usually work with just the blender default units.

06:59.230 --> 07:01.900
Now another couple of shortcut keys we should talk about.

07:01.900 --> 07:04.390
I'm going to switch to the move tool here.

07:04.450 --> 07:11.800
If I move this cube up I can always undo it by pressing control or command Z to undo if I hit the period

07:11.800 --> 07:14.140
key on the number pad.

07:14.140 --> 07:21.820
I'll zoom in to the selected object and that object will now become the center of rotation around which

07:21.820 --> 07:28.390
I tumble so if I zoom out here select the camera press the period key on the number pad.

07:28.600 --> 07:33.860
I'll now zoom or excuse me tumble around that camera.

07:34.450 --> 07:39.390
Now if you do not have a number pad if you're working on a laptop.

07:39.490 --> 07:47.170
One thing you can do is come over here to the file user preferences menu option and you can turn on

07:47.290 --> 07:48.880
emulate numpad.

07:48.880 --> 07:55.240
I have this turned on as it is just in case I don't have my little external number pad with me.

07:55.270 --> 08:03.010
I work on a laptop as well and so I keep this turned on so I can use either the numbers at the top of

08:03.010 --> 08:10.030
the keyboard or I can use my external number pad and then be sure and click save user settings.

08:10.030 --> 08:16.180
Now the reason why you may need a number pad is so that you can use the different views in Blender.

08:16.180 --> 08:23.980
So if I press the one key on the numpad I switch over to the front perspective view and I can switch

08:23.980 --> 08:32.140
to the front orthographic view by pressing the five key so I can toggle between perspective and orthographic.

08:32.200 --> 08:38.200
Now I can click the middle mouse button and tumble out of this and notice that I'm still in orthographic

08:38.200 --> 08:42.540
I can hit the five key to then come back to perspective.

08:42.670 --> 08:50.930
I can hit the three key to go to the side view and the seven key to go to the top you.

08:50.980 --> 08:59.780
So those are the main buttons you'll use on the number pad the period key and then the 1 3 5 and 7 keys.

09:00.330 --> 09:04.980
Well in the next video we'll take a look at the differences between object mode and edit mode.

09:05.290 --> 09:07.210
And we'll talk about the transform tools.
