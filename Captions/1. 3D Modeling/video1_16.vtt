WEBVTT

00:00.750 --> 00:03.780
Well we're pretty much done with our Lego guy here.

00:03.960 --> 00:12.600
Let's do a few more housekeeping chores and then maybe we can render an image out over here in the outliner.

00:12.880 --> 00:20.460
I've got quite a few objects that are named Kube cylinder etc. and we really need to take care of these

00:20.550 --> 00:24.100
and clean it up so we know what our objects are.

00:24.120 --> 00:28.980
This is really important if you're working with other people in a production pipeline.

00:28.980 --> 00:31.070
No one likes to get a scene.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.910
Open it up and see things named like cylinder 0 0 2.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.340
It's just hard to work with.

00:37.340 --> 00:45.830
So let's be kind to ourselves and our fellow coworkers select the head and rename it head.

00:46.410 --> 00:47.520
Let's do this.

00:47.520 --> 00:51.890
This looks like torso.

00:52.170 --> 00:55.200
This is arm l arm right.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.010
That looks fine.

00:57.030 --> 00:57.810
How about this.

00:57.810 --> 01:04.140
This looks like this could be called hips I guess we can call this just crotch.

01:04.140 --> 01:05.810
How about that.

01:05.820 --> 01:10.030
This one we can call leg underscore.

01:10.350 --> 01:17.440
Well and this one we can call leg underscore our.

01:17.650 --> 01:18.290
All right.

01:18.290 --> 01:25.790
That looks like we've got those pieces all named me scroll through here and make sure we haven't missed

01:25.790 --> 01:27.370
anything.

01:27.380 --> 01:31.940
There are a couple of objects that have this 0 0 1 on it.

01:31.940 --> 01:36.630
Those are just the ones that we copied to make a stack of blocks.

01:36.860 --> 01:42.500
But speaking of our blocks we should probably bring those back and take a look at the difference in

01:42.500 --> 01:43.900
scale.

01:43.910 --> 01:51.290
I'm going to press the shift key and select these other layers here and we can see that that's a little

01:51.290 --> 01:53.520
out of proportion.

01:53.620 --> 01:56.430
We can go ahead and select these objects here.

01:57.630 --> 02:04.390
And if we press the key and scale them down we can scale it down to a more reasonable size.

02:04.410 --> 02:07.290
This looks to be a little bit better.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.370
Let me ask you know down a tad more.

02:10.380 --> 02:18.720
Something like this maybe now we can do this because our pivot center is at the median point in other

02:18.720 --> 02:21.570
words the center of our selection.

02:21.570 --> 02:24.950
We can change this to individual origins 3D cursor.

02:25.020 --> 02:29.910
But for now the median point seems to be working pretty well for us.

02:29.910 --> 02:33.540
So I'm going to bring this down and kind of place it.

02:33.690 --> 02:34.020
I don't know.

02:34.020 --> 02:35.760
Somewhere around in here.

02:36.920 --> 02:41.240
And if we're going to have a little scene here we should probably have a floor.

02:41.430 --> 02:49.110
So I will click on the Create tab and create a polygon plane and I'll just scale this out so it's a

02:49.110 --> 02:50.430
little bit bigger.

02:50.670 --> 02:51.970
Something like this.

02:54.450 --> 03:01.310
And let's go ahead and create a camera and a light and see if we can render this scene out and see how

03:01.310 --> 03:02.300
it looks.

03:02.300 --> 03:07.990
So what I'll do is I'll come down here in the create tab and create a camera right here.

03:09.730 --> 03:18.510
And there it is it's kind of hard to see if we move it out here we can see it.

03:18.620 --> 03:24.460
I'll go ahead and create a new window so we can see what the camera sees.

03:24.500 --> 03:29.370
I'll just click this little tab right here and drag down.

03:29.630 --> 03:31.440
And now to switch to the camera.

03:31.460 --> 03:37.040
I'll just press the zero key on the number pad and that will then frame it up.

03:37.040 --> 03:45.830
So we're seeing through the camera now I can use my manipulator tools to move the camera around and

03:45.830 --> 03:57.910
frame up the scene so maybe I'll move it over here like this and move that back kind of like this.

03:57.910 --> 03:59.080
How about this.

03:59.290 --> 04:01.120
Yeah let's do that.

04:01.120 --> 04:10.050
Now if we switch to our rendered viewport shading right here you can see that we can't really see much.

04:10.390 --> 04:17.060
We need to add a light into the scene so let's once again add a polygon plane.

04:17.110 --> 04:18.720
Scroll up here.

04:19.230 --> 04:25.690
I'll create a plain and let's move it up and baby to one side.

04:25.700 --> 04:32.540
I'm going to move it to one side of the camera maybe to the right side of the camera here and click

04:32.660 --> 04:39.050
the rotate manipulator rotate that into place and scale it up.

04:39.120 --> 04:41.580
So that will be our light.

04:41.580 --> 04:45.390
Now you may be able to hear my computer fan begin to kick in.

04:45.390 --> 04:50.850
My apologies but it's just trying to keep up with the rendered image up here.

04:51.180 --> 05:01.800
OK so now let's add a material to this polygon plane to turn it into a light and move this up and move

05:01.860 --> 05:09.960
this up over here so we can see our properties panel and I'll switch to the material window and click

05:10.110 --> 05:19.310
new with this selected of course and let me change the name to light and I'll change the type of surface

05:19.340 --> 05:24.650
or material from a diffuse or color to any mission.

05:25.880 --> 05:29.510
And now we're beginning to see a little bit of light in here.

05:29.600 --> 05:33.530
I can take the strength up maybe take it up to five Let's see how that works.

05:33.560 --> 05:36.440
Yeah we're beginning to see something here.

05:36.740 --> 05:39.020
Let's take it up to 10 and see what happens.

05:39.110 --> 05:40.150
Maybe a little too much.

05:40.150 --> 05:40.970
Well that's not bad.

05:40.970 --> 05:42.450
Let's go with that.

05:42.530 --> 05:49.660
Now we also have under the world settings here we also have an ambient occlusion setting.

05:49.700 --> 05:50.990
We can turn this on.

05:51.000 --> 05:56.430
It'll it'll make things very bright but we can take the slider here and bring it down.

05:56.600 --> 06:02.510
And what this will do is this will kind of emphasize contacts shadows between the pieces.

06:02.660 --> 06:06.720
You can see what happens if we turn it off and turn it on here.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.410
So it just adds a little bit extra to the scene.

06:09.830 --> 06:11.880
So there we have a light in the scene now.

06:11.880 --> 06:15.550
There are a couple of problems I can see right up front here.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.870
First of all these pieces are hovering above the ground just a bit.

06:19.970 --> 06:25.960
Let me select these and move those down just a hair.

06:27.440 --> 06:28.270
Like that.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.300
Let's say.

06:29.560 --> 06:33.620
And also we don't have any colors for our character here.

06:33.640 --> 06:39.960
We need to add some materials to him so I'll select the head and come over here.

06:40.190 --> 06:42.210
And this is going to be a yellow.

06:42.290 --> 06:50.540
And it doesn't look like we have a yellow yet here so I click new for a new material call this yellow

06:53.900 --> 06:55.840
and click on the color swatch.

06:56.740 --> 06:59.260
And change it to yellow.

07:01.100 --> 07:01.880
All right.

07:02.120 --> 07:07.410
So we have that let's do the same thing for the arms and the legs.

07:07.490 --> 07:14.500
We can click the arm and add yellow do the same thing here.

07:15.410 --> 07:16.690
And on the legs

07:19.700 --> 07:24.100
OK so we have that looks like we need it on the hips as well.

07:25.750 --> 07:26.980
And here we go.

07:26.980 --> 07:29.750
Now we need a read on the torso.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.960
We can choose that from the list.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.320
There we go.

07:34.780 --> 07:40.150
Now we can render this image out if we like we can go back to the render window.

07:40.450 --> 07:50.440
And if I scroll down here I can see that under the sampling section the Render is the same as the preview.

07:50.440 --> 07:56.980
So this right here is what we're seeing as the preview and it's got some grain in it and isn't quite

07:56.980 --> 07:59.200
as good as what I'd like.

07:59.200 --> 08:07.450
So for the Render I will take this up to maybe 100 instead of 10 and let's scroll back up.

08:07.450 --> 08:15.080
And when I render this out I'd like it to render in a new window right here.

08:15.160 --> 08:18.520
Now this is our render settings right down here.

08:18.520 --> 08:24.150
Notice it's set for just half resolution as we render test or scene.

08:24.220 --> 08:26.070
I'll just leave it there for now.

08:26.260 --> 08:31.760
We can always increase that to bring it up to a full 19:20 by 10 80.

08:31.960 --> 08:34.430
But now let's give this a try.

08:34.450 --> 08:44.110
I'll just click the render button a window will open up and we can see our scene.

08:44.270 --> 08:51.770
Now if we want to save the image out to show the world we can come down here to image save as image.

08:51.770 --> 08:57.870
Give it a name and click save.

08:58.480 --> 08:59.760
And there we go.

09:00.160 --> 09:01.410
I finished 18.

09:01.870 --> 09:05.980
Well thank you for joining me for this introduction to blender in 3D modeling.

09:05.980 --> 09:11.050
We've come a long way since the beginning of the course we began with the fundamentals of Blender's

09:11.050 --> 09:13.030
interface and navigation.

09:13.240 --> 09:18.160
And then we talked about Blender's core editing tools like extrude and loop cut.

09:18.160 --> 09:23.980
We discussed how to look for the primitive shapes in any object and how to build up complex models with

09:23.980 --> 09:25.240
basic shapes.

09:25.510 --> 09:32.720
We created round extrusions from a surface with square polygons and learn how to join objects apply

09:32.740 --> 09:36.390
transformations and mirror objects along an axis.

09:36.400 --> 09:40.190
These are core skills that you'll build upon as you continue learning blender.

09:40.300 --> 09:46.570
So join me in the next course in our curriculum Blendr 111 materials and lighting as we talked more

09:46.570 --> 09:50.680
about creating compelling renderers of our 3D scenes.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.840
Thanks again and see you soon.
