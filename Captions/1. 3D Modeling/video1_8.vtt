00:00.640 --> 00:08.560
Well in a previous installment of this series we talked about smoothing or rounding off edges using

00:08.680 --> 00:09.780
the bevelled tool.

00:10.030 --> 00:11.940
Well there's another way to do that of course.

00:11.950 --> 00:18.980
There's always another way to do everything by using one of the modifiers in Blender called the subdivision

00:18.980 --> 00:21.160
surface modifier.

00:21.160 --> 00:24.080
So let's just take a look at this cube here.

00:24.220 --> 00:33.010
If I came over here to the modifiers panel and went to the ADD modifier menu and shows subdivision surface

00:33.910 --> 00:37.490
that modifier would actually try and smooth that object.

00:37.620 --> 00:40.900
And you can increase the subdivisions here in the view.

00:40.900 --> 00:47.620
So if I increase that to two or three you can see that it's beginning to smooth that object.

00:47.650 --> 00:53.970
Now another way of smoothing is to come over here under the Tools tab and use smooth shading.

00:54.220 --> 00:58.400
If I click that we get quite a smooth object there.

00:58.450 --> 01:07.210
Now if I hit the Z key on the keyboard you can see the geometry in there that the modifier is creating.

01:07.210 --> 01:15.130
Now if I hit the tab key to go into edit mode you can see that actually it's still just a cube to make

01:15.130 --> 01:16.330
these changes permanent.

01:16.330 --> 01:23.590
I'd have to click apply on the modifier so I'll bring this subdivisions down in the view here a couple

01:23.590 --> 01:24.470
of levels.

01:24.490 --> 01:27.670
Let's say I want the subdivisions at two.

01:27.780 --> 01:31.550
Now the subdivision here is affecting the entire object.

01:31.620 --> 01:35.120
What if I wanted this edge appear to be a little smoother.

01:35.300 --> 01:41.500
Let me I'm going to click on this guy right here this adjust at it cage and if I click on that you can

01:41.500 --> 01:48.510
see in edit mode here we can now see the smoothing that's happening.

01:48.700 --> 01:56.410
But what if I wanted this top part to be a little tighter in other words instead of it just being a

01:56.410 --> 02:04.140
ball maybe I want it to be like a drum maybe I want this top part to be a little flatter.

02:04.450 --> 02:10.930
Well what I can do is I can press control are to insert an edge loop here and if I click and drag up

02:11.440 --> 02:19.990
you can see that the closer that this edge gets to that top edge the tighter and more sharp that edge

02:19.990 --> 02:20.880
is.

02:20.890 --> 02:27.730
So if I move it up to here let's say and click now I've got something that's beginning to look kind

02:27.730 --> 02:34.600
of like a drum here and notice that down here at the bottom because there isn't an edge to hold this

02:34.690 --> 02:35.710
part down here.

02:35.710 --> 02:39.350
This is still very rounded.

02:39.480 --> 02:46.020
So let's say I wanted to make these edges a little sharper up here when I could do is insert more edge

02:46.020 --> 02:54.880
loops I'll press control r and maybe scroll the mouse wheel wants to create two edges and click.

02:55.120 --> 03:01.720
And now you can see that that edge is getting tighter and tighter up here now not going to insert two

03:01.780 --> 03:03.060
edges over here.

03:03.160 --> 03:11.880
Scroll the mouse wheel and click and now you can see that what we're getting is something that's actually

03:11.880 --> 03:19.590
a little bit more realistic since there isn't really any absolutely sharp edges in the world.

03:19.830 --> 03:23.550
They're oftentimes just a little bit curved.

03:23.550 --> 03:26.890
We're beginning to get more of a realistic edge here.

03:27.030 --> 03:30.390
And when you have an edge like this it's just a little bit curved.

03:30.390 --> 03:38.230
It'll catch the light in your scene and provide a little more interest and a little more realism.

03:38.310 --> 03:41.130
So how can we use this in our modeling.

03:41.300 --> 03:48.040
Well what I'd like to do is go over the process of creating a couple of Lego pieces.

03:48.360 --> 03:55.200
I think this is a great exercise to go through to think about how to get these sharp but slightly rounded

03:55.200 --> 03:58.260
edges on something like a Lego block.

03:58.260 --> 04:07.260
And in addition it introduces the concept of extruding a circular piece out of a square or block object.

04:07.500 --> 04:14.000
And that's a tool or a process that you can use a lot when you're modeling.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.220
So let's take a look at how to do that.

04:16.260 --> 04:24.210
First of all I'll get rid of this object here I'll just select it press the x key and hit delete.

04:24.230 --> 04:28.980
I will also delete the camera and the point light here in the scene.

04:29.090 --> 04:35.610
We don't need those right now as we're modeling so I'll press the x key and click delete.

04:35.720 --> 04:43.580
So the first thing I think I'd like to do is create one of these one tops just this little one singular

04:43.580 --> 04:51.800
piece with the one round extrusion on it and then from this one we can use it as a template to create

04:52.070 --> 04:54.100
all the other pieces.

04:54.170 --> 04:58.390
So to begin with let's start with a polygon plane.

04:58.440 --> 05:05.180
I'm going to come over here to the Create tab choose plain and I'll zoom in.

05:05.180 --> 05:08.750
And what we need here is a little more resolution.

05:08.750 --> 05:10.290
We need more polygons.

05:10.400 --> 05:13.890
What I'd like is four by four on here.

05:14.150 --> 05:16.630
So to do that I'm going to tab into edit mode.

05:16.640 --> 05:22.870
Hitting the tab key and then I'm going to press the W key for the specials menu.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.900
And I'm going to come up here and choose subdivide.

05:25.970 --> 05:35.180
So if I click that it subdivides it into four polygons and if I pull this panel up I can choose the

05:35.270 --> 05:38.120
number of cuts and currently it's at 1.

05:38.150 --> 05:45.290
If I click here to increase it to two I get three by three polygons and if I click this one more time

05:45.680 --> 05:49.590
I get four by four polygons and that's what I want.

05:49.640 --> 05:55.130
Now what I'd like to do is delete the four faces in the center here.

05:55.130 --> 06:02.450
So I'm going to press control tab click face in the mesh select menu here and now I'm just going to

06:02.450 --> 06:05.330
select these four faces.

06:06.060 --> 06:11.310
And hit X and choose delete faces.

06:11.310 --> 06:18.820
All right so now I have a hole in this polygon plane that has one two three four five six seven eight

06:19.090 --> 06:20.320
sides in it.

06:20.500 --> 06:28.370
And what I'd like to do is this is the whole in which I want to extrude a round circular piece.

06:28.480 --> 06:33.360
So what I need is a round piece that has eight sides.

06:33.370 --> 06:39.750
So to do that I'll come back over to my Create tab tab back into object mode.

06:39.920 --> 06:48.940
I'll come over here to the Create tab click on cylinder and for the cylinder I don't need 32 sides I

06:48.940 --> 06:51.070
only need 8.

06:51.220 --> 06:58.560
And in addition I don't want the cap filled to be an end and I don't want it to be an eight sided polygon.

06:58.630 --> 07:01.780
I just want it to be a triangle fan.

07:03.000 --> 07:06.200
So there is my cylinder No.

07:06.210 --> 07:10.710
The interesting thing about this is I only need the top part.

07:10.740 --> 07:14.960
I mean hit the ESC key and scale this down to size here.

07:15.750 --> 07:22.620
And if I hit the tab key now I can select only the parts that I do not need.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.660
So I want to keep this top part.

07:24.660 --> 07:28.210
So all de-selected these with Schiff's select.

07:28.450 --> 07:31.780
And then I'm going to press X and delete faces.

07:31.810 --> 07:38.950
Now I have a circular piece that I can extrude out of this but I need to move it down in line with this

07:38.950 --> 07:41.950
polygon plane so I'll tab out of edit mode.

07:42.160 --> 07:48.330
I will come over here and I want to move this pivot point to the center of this object.

07:48.370 --> 07:56.340
So I go to tools and set origin to geometry and we go.

07:56.340 --> 08:01.320
Now I want to move this object to the center of the grid or to the 3D cursor.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.770
Now I have the 3D cursor already there.

08:03.830 --> 08:10.350
I'm going to press shift S and I can of course move the cursor to the center of the grid here and then

08:10.350 --> 08:16.020
I can press shift s and move the selection to the cursor.

08:16.140 --> 08:21.290
And now it's pop down there in line with the polygon plane.

08:21.330 --> 08:26.490
Now to connect these two pieces up I need to join them together into one object.

08:26.490 --> 08:29.780
There currently a plane and a cylinder.

08:29.820 --> 08:33.900
I'm going to select both of these and press control J.

08:34.290 --> 08:37.980
And that will join them into one object.

08:37.980 --> 08:45.530
Now if I tab back into edit mode I can see that the whole thing now is all one object I'll press control

08:45.540 --> 08:48.880
tab go to vertex mode.

08:49.110 --> 08:56.220
And now what I'd like to do is connect up the polygon plane to the cylinder and I want to connect it

08:56.340 --> 09:00.990
this way so that this round piece stays round.

09:01.050 --> 09:10.860
So I get to select a vertex shift select another one and press Allt him and choose to merge at the last

09:10.860 --> 09:12.350
vertex I selected.

09:12.360 --> 09:18.230
So it's going to move this one to the circular object so wealths like this vertex.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.840
And this one Allt in at last.

09:21.930 --> 09:29.650
It's like these two alt in him at last and I'll just go around and do this.

09:29.740 --> 09:33.480
And lastly allt him and at last.

09:33.480 --> 09:38.890
Now I have a circular object in a square shape.

09:39.010 --> 09:39.970
That's good.

09:39.970 --> 09:42.690
However these are kind of stretched.

09:42.730 --> 09:47.800
I'd like to scale this up so these are more uniform.

09:47.800 --> 09:55.960
So in a press control tab go to face mode press the see key to go to the circle select tool and you

09:55.960 --> 10:03.580
can see here that I've got this round brush type thing and I'm going to scroll the mouse wheel up or

10:03.580 --> 10:10.180
down with the scroll wheel and just click and drag and select those faces to get out of the circle select

10:10.180 --> 10:10.520
tool.

10:10.520 --> 10:19.290
All right click and now I've got these faces selected so I'll just hit the s key and scale up and tell

10:19.300 --> 10:21.900
these polygons are more uniform.

10:21.940 --> 10:28.040
I'm looking for the ones on the corners here to be 90 degree angles.

10:28.120 --> 10:28.740
All right.

10:28.780 --> 10:35.590
Now I have that circular piece ready to be extruded out of that flat plain.

10:35.590 --> 10:44.000
So with these faces selected I'll just press the e key and drag straight up and there we have the top

10:44.210 --> 10:51.910
of our Lego piece now here's where our subdivision surface modifier comes into play.

10:52.040 --> 10:59.800
So I'll come over here to the Add modifiers menu and I'll choose this subdivision surfaces.

10:59.980 --> 11:08.350
And now you can see it's beginning to smooth it all take the view up to Alt-Tab back into object mode

11:08.380 --> 11:15.190
and you can see the polygons here that is beginning to create in the tools tab or click the smooth shading

11:15.220 --> 11:18.410
button and that smooths it out some.

11:18.430 --> 11:26.450
And now over here I'm going to select the adjust edit cage button and I'll tab back into edit mode and

11:26.450 --> 11:32.000
now you can see the cage has been molded to the smooth object.

11:32.000 --> 11:36.690
If I turn this off you can see the unsmooth cage.

11:36.880 --> 11:43.280
What am I to do is go ahead and press control r and create an edge loop right in here and I can move

11:43.280 --> 11:44.680
that up or down.

11:44.690 --> 11:53.220
Maybe I'll move it down to here or create another edge loop right above that to hold this top edge.

11:53.350 --> 11:54.400
There we go.

11:54.680 --> 12:01.340
Now what if I wanted to insert an edge loop right up here so that it would hold this top edge a little

12:01.340 --> 12:02.260
tighter.

12:02.480 --> 12:09.080
If I came up here and press control r and hovered over one of these edges it doesn't give me a preview.

12:09.080 --> 12:13.320
Now if I hover over one of these edges it does or over these edges it does.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.590
But up here it won't.

12:15.620 --> 12:23.360
The reason why it won't do that is because it can only insert edges through quads or through four sided

12:23.360 --> 12:32.330
polygons it can't insert edges through tries three sided polygons or in guns any polygons that have

12:32.330 --> 12:34.260
more than four sides.

12:34.520 --> 12:39.590
So what we need to do is figure out a way to insert an edge loop without actually inserting an edge

12:39.590 --> 12:40.090
loop.

12:40.250 --> 12:46.660
And the easiest way to do that I think is just to extrude these faces and then scale them in a bit.

12:46.670 --> 12:56.360
So if I control tab here to bring up the mesh select menu and choose face I'll then hit the C key circle

12:56.360 --> 12:57.650
select these.

12:57.650 --> 13:06.710
Now if I hit extrude and click I can scale this in or out and you can see I've created essentially a

13:06.710 --> 13:10.580
new Angelou pier that I can adjust in and out.

13:10.580 --> 13:17.780
So if I put this right about here you can see I have some control now over how tight that edge is.

13:17.780 --> 13:25.680
So I can go to control tab choose edges to choose this edge all the way around I'll press Alt click

13:26.300 --> 13:33.940
and now I can move this edge up and down and just how tight that corner needs to be.

13:33.950 --> 13:37.720
So let's say I wanted to be about like that.

13:37.780 --> 13:38.280
All right.

13:38.290 --> 13:43.000
So there is the top of our Lego piece.

13:43.000 --> 13:49.310
Now we can look at our object without the subdivisions enabled here by just clicking this little eye.

13:49.500 --> 13:58.060
The display modifier in viewport button I'll just click that and you can see it's gone back to the unsmooth

13:58.180 --> 13:59.440
view.

13:59.500 --> 14:05.260
So now I'm going to call this in the outline or I'll change the name and I'll call this template and

14:05.260 --> 14:10.850
this is going to be the template that we'll use for every subsequent Lego block.
