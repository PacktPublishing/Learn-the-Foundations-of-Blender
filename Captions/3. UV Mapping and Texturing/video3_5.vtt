00:00.710 --> 00:06.500
Now let's think about how we might create a U.V. map of all of the objects at once.

00:06.630 --> 00:16.950
So instead of having just the door here with its own U-V map and the door knob and the plate with their

00:16.950 --> 00:24.780
own U-V maps we can combine them all together so that all of the U.V. islands are here all within the

00:24.780 --> 00:26.250
0 to 1 space.

00:26.250 --> 00:31.680
So what I'll do is go into object mode and just select everything with the 8 key and then I'll press

00:31.680 --> 00:35.900
control J to combine everything into one object.

00:36.180 --> 00:43.350
So now if we tab into edit mode and select all of our faces you can see that here all the U-V islands

00:43.770 --> 00:47.720
all compressed into the zero to one space but overlapping each other.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.320
And this is a problem we can't have that.

00:50.760 --> 00:58.710
So as we saw previously what we can do is select all of the U-V islands and press control a to average

00:58.710 --> 00:59.790
Island scale.

00:59.790 --> 01:08.130
I'll do that and then press control P to pack Islands and there we go.

01:08.130 --> 01:15.630
Now what this has done is this has made all of our U-V islands proportionally the same size as they

01:15.630 --> 01:24.060
are here in the 3D view we can of course adjust this a bit if we want say the door knobs to take up

01:24.060 --> 01:31.590
more of the resolution space in our U.V. map with U-V islands selection enabled.

01:31.590 --> 01:38.970
We could come through and select our islands representing the door and we could scale those down with

01:38.970 --> 01:45.410
the key and maybe move those into a corner and then scale these up as well.

01:45.740 --> 01:57.090
But let's talk about these door knobs now do we really need to take up space for both of the door knobs.

01:57.150 --> 02:04.260
I'm thinking that we're only ever going to see one door knob or the other.

02:04.340 --> 02:08.770
We aren't really ever going to see both of them at the same time.

02:08.930 --> 02:17.250
So what we could do is optimize our U-V map a little bit better and have just one collection of U-V

02:17.300 --> 02:20.940
islands representing both of the door knobs.

02:21.020 --> 02:22.110
So how to do that.

02:22.130 --> 02:28.460
Well first of all I think what we should do is now that we've combined all of our objects together into

02:28.460 --> 02:29.410
one.

02:29.510 --> 02:38.140
Let's go ahead and select this door knob here just one of them and select this with the L key.

02:38.150 --> 02:45.260
Now we should also mention when we're using this LTE key select We have the ability to the limit our

02:45.260 --> 02:49.950
selection by material or seam or Uvas.

02:49.970 --> 02:58.370
Let me show you what that means if we selected this part of the door knob here with the L key and then

02:58.370 --> 03:00.470
turned on seam.

03:00.590 --> 03:05.720
You can see that what happens is only the part within that seam has been selected.

03:05.720 --> 03:13.010
Now I can press shift and click to turn that off but if you're selecting areas with the L key and it

03:13.010 --> 03:20.600
isn't all being selected check the delimit buttons here and you can always turn them off by pressing

03:20.660 --> 03:23.570
shift and then clicking the button.

03:23.600 --> 03:27.850
All right so I'm going to hover over this piece and press the key.

03:27.860 --> 03:33.170
And now I'm going to hit X and delete faces.

03:33.170 --> 03:40.850
Now that that is gone let's go ahead and remove the map this I'll press you and unwrap.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.250
Now there we go.

03:42.410 --> 03:50.870
We can test out the unwrap by switching to conformal and that changes it a little bit but not much.

03:51.140 --> 03:59.390
We can adjust the margin between the U-V islands here and maybe I'll take this down to point 0 1 and

03:59.390 --> 04:07.840
we can also if we want select all of these U-V islands and press our 9:0 and rotate them around a bit

04:07.930 --> 04:13.150
to if we want all of our door U-V islands going up and down.

04:13.310 --> 04:15.510
But what about that door knob.

04:15.890 --> 04:20.870
Well what we can do now is just select this piece here.

04:21.790 --> 04:34.960
And if we duplicate it shift D and enter now we can use the mesh mirror y global to flip that piece

04:35.050 --> 04:37.390
around and then move it over here.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.590
And put it right on the door on this side.

04:44.440 --> 04:45.860
And look at what's happened.

04:46.000 --> 04:52.070
There isn't any new U-V islands in our U-V map.

04:52.120 --> 05:01.090
In fact if we zoom in here and take a look at say this piece here I'll just select it with U-V Island

05:01.090 --> 05:10.210
selection and then if I hit the G key and move it aside you can see that the U.V. map for the duplicate

05:10.210 --> 05:15.730
door knob has been placed exactly on top of the U-V map for the original.

05:15.940 --> 05:21.980
So in texturing one we automatically texture the other.

05:22.240 --> 05:29.580
You'll see this used quite a bit in game texturing where to maximize the resolution within the 0 to

05:29.590 --> 05:37.750
1 space they will just the map one side of a symmetrical character and then when textures are applied

05:37.750 --> 05:42.580
to that one side they're also applied to the other as well.

05:42.580 --> 05:49.540
All right so now that we have the U-V map for our door we need to think about how we're going to apply

05:49.540 --> 05:51.880
our textures and to do that.

05:51.880 --> 05:54.750
I'll go ahead and use GIMP.

05:54.750 --> 06:01.900
The free open source image editing program to lay down some woodgrain texture and texture for the door

06:01.900 --> 06:11.650
knobs and plate and to do that we'll need a copy of our U-V map here to take into gimp so to export

06:11.650 --> 06:23.210
this U-V map out of Blendr we just need to come down here to Uvas export lay out and here we can choose

06:23.210 --> 06:25.400
a place for our U-V map.

06:25.400 --> 06:39.920
So I'm going to create a folder called textures and in here I will put our door Uvas down here we can

06:39.920 --> 06:41.540
choose what size we want.

06:41.540 --> 06:43.330
Are you the map to be.

06:43.470 --> 06:46.310
I'll go ahead and begin with 2048.

06:46.370 --> 06:54.430
We usually create our textures in powers of two like 2048 or 10:24 or 5:12.

06:54.620 --> 07:00.650
So they can be processed more quickly and things like a game engine and it's good to create your textures

07:00.650 --> 07:01.330
big.

07:01.580 --> 07:08.810
And then if needed be able to save out a lower resolution of them this is better than beginning small

07:08.810 --> 07:15.330
and trying to increase the size of a texture because that would just make it blurry and pixilated.

07:15.680 --> 07:23.790
So I'll go ahead and export this out and in the next video will open up Gimp and begin laying down our

07:23.790 --> 07:24.330
textures.
