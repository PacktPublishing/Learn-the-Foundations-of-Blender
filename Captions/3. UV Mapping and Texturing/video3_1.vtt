00:00.420 --> 00:07.040
In this course we'll ask and hopefully answer the fundamental questions of what is U-V mapping.

00:07.390 --> 00:08.670
And why do we need it.

00:09.010 --> 00:10.700
What is it used for.

00:10.960 --> 00:14.330
So let's begin right off with what is U-V mapping.

00:14.680 --> 00:22.240
Well it's really the process of creating a two dimensional representation of our 3D object.

00:22.330 --> 00:24.430
That's really all it is.

00:24.520 --> 00:32.650
It's almost as if we would take a cereal box and cut it along an edge and open it up and lay it flat

00:32.980 --> 00:35.140
down on a kitchen counter.

00:35.260 --> 00:37.750
That's really what U-V mapping is.

00:38.140 --> 00:45.490
And we do this so that we can apply images and photographs and textures to our object in the same way

00:45.490 --> 00:51.380
that this cereal box has had designs and images applied to it here.

00:51.490 --> 00:59.740
And then once those images are applied the cereal box is assembled into its three dimensional form.

00:59.740 --> 01:01.830
So that's really all we're doing.

01:01.930 --> 01:08.470
We're cutting the three dimensional object apart laying it flat so we can apply two dimensional images

01:08.470 --> 01:09.190
to it.

01:09.460 --> 01:17.180
And then we're reconstructing or wrapping those images back around that three dimensional object.

01:17.590 --> 01:21.980
So blender gives us a lot of tools to go through this process.

01:22.030 --> 01:28.780
One of the great tools I think is over here in the screen layout menu we can choose this U-V editing

01:28.780 --> 01:30.180
screen layout.

01:30.550 --> 01:38.980
And if we do that we get a very nice layout of our object and the U-V editor you come down here to this

01:38.980 --> 01:39.400
menu.

01:39.400 --> 01:45.820
You can see that the U.V. image editor is right here and that's what we're taking a look at here.

01:45.850 --> 01:53.770
Now what I like to do as well to add to this particular screen layout is to grab this tab here and drag

01:53.770 --> 01:58.680
it down a bit and create a node editor window.

01:58.690 --> 02:06.550
So I'm going to come over here to this menu and click on Node Ed. And that gives me a view of the node

02:06.570 --> 02:07.230
Ed..

02:07.490 --> 02:13.840
The U-V image editor and the 3D view all in one screen layout.

02:13.840 --> 02:18.750
Now I also should point out that I'm using the cycle's render engine here.

02:18.850 --> 02:25.300
If you're just opening Blendr up you may see that it's set to the Blendr render engine and that's an

02:25.330 --> 02:32.320
older render engine from the original versions of Blendr the cycle's render engine I think is a more

02:32.530 --> 02:34.010
modern render engine.

02:34.030 --> 02:36.200
And I think it's more realistic.

02:36.220 --> 02:39.310
So I'm going to go ahead and use this here.

02:39.310 --> 02:45.070
The reason why I bring that up is because the nodes in the node editor may look a little different if

02:45.400 --> 02:48.600
you're using the blender render engine.

02:48.620 --> 02:55.220
So let's first off just begin by trying to U-V unwrap this cube just like that cereal box.

02:55.250 --> 03:01.330
Let's see if we can open it up and lay it flat here in our U-V image Ed..

03:01.880 --> 03:03.960
There are a couple of ways to do that.

03:04.010 --> 03:11.420
I'm going to tap into edit mode and here in the U-V editing screen layout you can see that we can kind

03:11.420 --> 03:18.440
of see through our object in edit mode and that's because we have this turned off right down here this

03:18.770 --> 03:21.560
limit selection to visible.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.900
If I turn that on you can see we can't see through it.

03:24.980 --> 03:31.180
And this is the way I like to work if you would like to keep this so that you can see through it.

03:31.220 --> 03:32.900
That's fine too.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.540
So I get to go and turn that on.

03:34.880 --> 03:40.180
So here in edit mode the first thing I'm going to do is press the key on the keyboard.

03:40.190 --> 03:44.120
And that brings up this the mapping menu.

03:44.120 --> 03:52.600
We have several selections here we have unwrap smart U-V project like map pack.

03:52.660 --> 03:59.900
There's quite a few others down here but I think the main ones we're going to be using is unwrap and

03:59.900 --> 04:01.750
smart U-V project.

04:01.970 --> 04:09.080
Let's go ahead and try smart U.V. project click on that and then click OK.

04:09.180 --> 04:10.820
And this is what happens.

04:10.830 --> 04:18.480
So what blender has done for us is it's taken each of the faces of this object and laid them out flat

04:18.660 --> 04:20.620
in our U-V image editor.

04:20.700 --> 04:26.880
I'm going to come over here to this little checkbox and turn on this stretch colourations So I'll turn

04:26.880 --> 04:27.530
that on.

04:27.690 --> 04:30.140
And that we can see these a little better.

04:30.150 --> 04:34.980
So what would this look like now if we were to apply images to this object.

04:35.220 --> 04:43.380
Well Blendr has a nice U-V test pattern that we can use to lay onto our object and kind of get a sense

04:43.380 --> 04:47.560
of how the images will be applied to our object.

04:47.580 --> 04:51.110
So I come down here and I'll click new.

04:51.420 --> 04:57.910
And here we can choose what kind of image we want to apply to our U.V. image editor.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.360
I'm going to change the name here.

04:59.370 --> 05:09.600
I'll call it U-V test and currently 10:24 by 10:24 is just fine for the resolution but right down here

05:09.630 --> 05:16.410
under generated type I want to change this from blank to U-V grid and if I click that and then click

05:16.440 --> 05:23.560
OK you can see here that we've created a U-V grid underneath our U-V islands.

05:23.610 --> 05:32.550
If I come over here and turn off the stretch coloration here you can see it underneath those U-V islands.

05:32.580 --> 05:35.100
All right I'll turn that back on.

05:35.250 --> 05:40.820
Now what I'd like to do is apply that checker pattern to my object here.

05:41.070 --> 05:47.130
So to do that I'm going to have to apply that texture to the material of the object and you can see

05:47.130 --> 05:50.840
up here in the node Ed. that it does have a material.

05:50.880 --> 05:55.790
This is just the default cube that is present when you open up a scene in blender.

05:55.890 --> 06:03.000
I'm going to click used node's right here and now we can see the diffuse and material output nodes for

06:03.000 --> 06:05.580
this particular material.

06:05.580 --> 06:13.350
Now if you're new to materials and the node Ed. Please check out Blendr 201 materials and lighting where

06:13.350 --> 06:20.080
we go into more detail about how to create and adjust material settings in Blender.

06:20.190 --> 06:27.420
But now that I have the nodes here I want to apply that image texture here that U-V test pattern so

06:27.420 --> 06:34.430
I'll press shift day and under texture I'll choose image texture.

06:34.440 --> 06:43.160
Now I can pull down this little menu right here and choose my U-V test pattern I'll hook it up to the

06:43.160 --> 06:44.930
diffuse node.

06:45.140 --> 06:52.760
And now if I come over here and change my viewport shading from solid to texture we can see it here

06:52.850 --> 06:54.100
in the viewport.

06:54.670 --> 06:57.240
All right you say but what good does that do us.

06:57.260 --> 07:05.030
Well if we come over here we can see we have different ways to select our UVA's we can select them by

07:05.030 --> 07:11.720
U-V island by U-V face edge or vertex with vertex selected.

07:11.720 --> 07:18.200
I'll go ahead and just select one of these and I'll hit the G key and move it around and you can see

07:18.200 --> 07:27.780
as I do the stretch color changes from blue to green and the more I pull it the more stretched it gets.

07:28.310 --> 07:34.580
But if we tumble around on our cube here we can see that here is that face.

07:34.710 --> 07:38.930
I'll hit the G key again and move that vertex around.

07:39.170 --> 07:48.230
So it's pretty clear with this that the position and the layout of our U-V islands is very important

07:48.230 --> 07:52.250
for how our textures are going to lay down on our object.

07:52.340 --> 07:58.060
If we just wanted this checker pattern on our object this is definitely not what we would want.

07:58.520 --> 08:06.450
So I will undo this if we choose say an edge or go to edge display and select an edge.

08:06.470 --> 08:14.900
I can hit the G key and move that around and you can see how stretched that face will get as well.

08:14.900 --> 08:23.060
So the purpose of U-V unwrapping is to allow us to put images on our 3D object.

08:23.150 --> 08:30.380
However what we can see here is that the lay out of our U-V map is very important to how the textures

08:30.410 --> 08:32.390
are applied to our objects.

08:32.510 --> 08:38.490
So in the next video we'll talk about other ways of U-V unwrapping our objects.
