00:00.890 --> 00:05.810
Now let's take a look at the other parts of the object Alt-Tab back into object mode and I'll press

00:05.900 --> 00:12.580
alt h to bring everything else back and let's take a look at one of these doorknobs.

00:12.680 --> 00:17.850
I'll select it press shift H and frame it up with the period key.

00:17.900 --> 00:20.750
Now for this object I'll tab into edit mode.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.930
Let's take a look at this.

00:23.180 --> 00:27.370
If I zoom in a little bit too much there I get some clipping issues.

00:27.380 --> 00:31.800
We can press the N key and adjust the clipping.

00:31.820 --> 00:33.110
Start here.

00:33.140 --> 00:34.450
It's currently at point 1.

00:34.460 --> 00:38.070
I could set it to point 0 1 and see if that helps.

00:38.240 --> 00:41.930
And it does hit the in key again there.

00:41.990 --> 00:49.160
Now this object is really two pieces if I hover over this part and press the L key you can see that

00:49.160 --> 00:58.400
it only selects that piece and if I then hover over this piece and press the key it only selects that

00:58.400 --> 01:01.600
piece so we can break this up into two parts.

01:01.640 --> 01:06.950
I'll go ahead and select this and press you and unwrap and that's what we get.

01:06.980 --> 01:08.540
That's not too bad.

01:08.540 --> 01:15.890
You can see some of the stretching happening here in the light blue area but I don't think that's going

01:15.890 --> 01:22.220
to be a problem since this will probably be a fairly uniform texture that goes onto this.

01:22.460 --> 01:26.140
I'll hit the A key to de-select that and then I'll press the L key.

01:26.150 --> 01:33.160
And now for this part we could go ahead and try and press you and unwrap and see what happens.

01:33.170 --> 01:40.250
But we've got quite a bit of green here and that may be stretching that could be unacceptable even with

01:40.280 --> 01:42.260
a relatively uniform texture.

01:42.410 --> 01:48.540
But one way to test that is to apply our U-V test material and texture to this object.

01:48.740 --> 01:55.190
So I'll just come over here and pull down this menu in the note editor and I'll just click U-V test.

01:55.190 --> 02:02.600
Now if we tab into object mode we can see what's happening here on our object that's not looking very

02:02.600 --> 02:03.530
good.

02:03.680 --> 02:08.260
So we need to come up with a different solution for this door knob.

02:08.510 --> 02:12.260
So if we tab back into edit mode let's think about this.

02:12.320 --> 02:16.620
I'm going to press alt Z to go back to solid shading.

02:18.960 --> 02:22.480
And here's where we can begin to think about hiding our seams.

02:22.500 --> 02:31.160
So maybe we want to split this out at this seam here control E. and Mark seam.

02:31.320 --> 02:37.320
Once we do that though this is now going to be a cylindrical piece and we'll want to split this up so

02:37.320 --> 02:38.970
it lays down flat.

02:39.030 --> 02:44.250
So I'll go ahead and assign a seam here as well.

02:44.250 --> 02:47.820
Now we may need to split out this piece here.

02:48.090 --> 02:55.230
We can create a seam there even though that's right up front and in our view that may be acceptable

02:55.230 --> 02:58.660
in terms of this particular object.

02:58.710 --> 03:02.190
And then I think I'll select an edge right down here

03:05.170 --> 03:07.690
and de-select this piece right there.

03:07.690 --> 03:11.770
So that's going to be split as a cylinder and lay down flat.

03:11.770 --> 03:13.630
Let's give it a try.

03:13.660 --> 03:18.560
I'll hit l you and enwrap.

03:18.560 --> 03:25.760
So now are you the islands are laying down a little bit flatter without as much stretching let's press

03:25.850 --> 03:32.300
alt Z and go back to our textured view and see what we think.

03:32.550 --> 03:34.320
It's looking better.

03:34.320 --> 03:40.590
In fact this may be just fine in terms of our uniform metal texture.

03:40.590 --> 03:47.700
If this were an object where there were text or words written across this area right here we may not

03:47.700 --> 03:55.290
be able to have that seem right there because it would break up that word but with a metallic texture

03:55.950 --> 03:57.700
that might just work.

03:57.720 --> 04:02.220
So let's go back into edit mode and let's select everything.

04:02.230 --> 04:09.800
Now we can see here that we've got our U-V islands overlapping each other within our zero to one space.

04:09.990 --> 04:13.590
And that's not good if we laid down a texture on this.

04:13.590 --> 04:17.790
We would have the same texture happening in multiple U-V islands.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.710
And we want to avoid that.

04:19.770 --> 04:25.410
So some nice tools that Blendr offers us is down here under the UVA's menu.

04:25.500 --> 04:33.240
We've got these two average Island scale and pack islands average Island scale will take all of these

04:33.240 --> 04:40.500
U-V islands and scale them so they're proportionally the same size as the same pieces over in the 3D

04:40.500 --> 04:41.690
object.

04:41.760 --> 04:44.530
So to do that I'll go ahead and press control a.

04:44.550 --> 04:46.860
Which is our shortcut key for that.

04:47.130 --> 04:53.040
And then we went to pack them into this zero to one space as we talked about previously and to do that

04:53.080 --> 04:57.870
we can press control P and that packs the man.

04:57.870 --> 05:05.210
So we'll be using these tools quite a bit as we put together the final U-V map of our object here.

05:05.220 --> 05:07.270
So let's try another piece.

05:07.350 --> 05:13.980
I will tab back into object mode press alt H and let's take a look at this piece right here.

05:14.050 --> 05:15.450
Press shift H.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.550
And this is a pretty simple piece.

05:18.600 --> 05:23.020
It's just a plate with the back face deleted.

05:23.190 --> 05:27.740
We could go ahead and just select this and press you and unwrap and see what happens.

05:27.750 --> 05:30.300
And because these corners are connected.

05:30.300 --> 05:35.060
They're pulling quite a bit as it tries to lay it out flat.

05:35.070 --> 05:40.330
So what I can do is select these individual edges here.

05:44.330 --> 05:56.070
Mark seems and then when we U-V unwrap again we should see those corners relaxing a bit and there we

05:56.070 --> 05:57.210
go.

05:57.210 --> 06:01.660
I'm going to press control up arrow so we can see it full screen.

06:02.760 --> 06:09.360
And you can see here that those corners have been split apart which allows this whole piece to lay down

06:09.360 --> 06:12.440
flat without any stretching and that's good.

06:12.580 --> 06:15.110
I want to hit Control up arrow again.

06:15.510 --> 06:21.570
And so there we have our pieces U-V Matt press alt H.

06:21.600 --> 06:25.460
And now you may be wondering what about this piece over here.

06:25.740 --> 06:35.940
Well we could use the map this again or we could just selected delete it and then duplicate and mirror

06:36.270 --> 06:38.080
this object over.

06:38.130 --> 06:44.400
So let's try that with this selected I'll go ahead and press control up arrow so we can see it a little

06:44.400 --> 06:44.980
better.

06:46.000 --> 06:54.640
With this selected press shift D and hit enter and then I'll come down here to the object menu choose

06:54.850 --> 07:03.300
mirror and then I'll choose the Y global axis here I'll choose Y and hit enter and there we go.

07:03.300 --> 07:07.330
So now we have our object mirrored over to the other side.

07:07.540 --> 07:15.880
And this work too because our pivot point or object origin was down here in the center of the grid in

07:15.880 --> 07:17.350
the center of the door.

07:18.150 --> 07:18.930
All right.

07:19.170 --> 07:26.370
So now our press control up arrow once again in the next video what let's do is let's combine all of

07:26.370 --> 07:33.740
these into one object and then use our scale and pack tools to pack it into the 0 to 1 space.
