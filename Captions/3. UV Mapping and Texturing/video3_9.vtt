00:00.830 --> 00:03.060
So here we are back in Gimp.

00:03.260 --> 00:12.590
What we need to do is just take our beer can label and our can top and place them here on our U.V. map.

00:12.590 --> 00:14.920
So I'll grab this one here.

00:14.930 --> 00:20.830
I'll select everything and copy it and I'll come over here and I'll paste it in.

00:20.840 --> 00:22.810
Now it's a little too big.

00:22.910 --> 00:28.340
Zoom out a bit with the minus key and we can see the outline of the image here.

00:28.550 --> 00:34.010
I need to make this pasted layer into an actual layer that we can edit.

00:34.010 --> 00:38.200
So all right click and choose two new layer.

00:38.280 --> 00:42.530
I'll give this layer a name or call it label.

00:43.560 --> 00:46.670
Now let's come over here to the scale tool right here.

00:46.670 --> 00:49.600
Click on the image and click and drag this.

00:49.610 --> 00:57.080
But first I need to lock the aspect ratio here with the width than the height click and drag this and

00:57.080 --> 00:57.770
get it down.

00:57.770 --> 01:02.530
So it's a little bit more reasonable for our U-V map.

01:02.600 --> 01:03.870
I'll hit enter.

01:04.040 --> 01:08.360
Go to the move tool and try and move this in place.

01:08.450 --> 01:10.880
So I've pretty much got it there.

01:10.940 --> 01:12.290
That's not bad.

01:12.350 --> 01:19.340
I'll take this layer and move it down below the U-V islands and get dizzy and zoom in so he can see

01:19.340 --> 01:19.880
it.

01:20.240 --> 01:25.790
Now if I click here and drag you can see I'm dragging the U-V layer here I don't want to do that.

01:25.790 --> 01:27.020
I'll hit command Z.

01:27.020 --> 01:32.090
I can come over here to the tool options and choose Move Active layer.

01:32.090 --> 01:40.060
And now with the label layer active I can click and drag that around and I kind of want to get it right

01:40.870 --> 01:47.580
there go back to my scale and let's move this out just a bit.

01:49.070 --> 01:53.550
So now let's go grab that beer can image or the beer can top.

01:53.550 --> 02:00.730
I'll grab this and select it with command D command C and let's come back over here and paste it onto

02:00.760 --> 02:01.960
our image.

02:01.970 --> 02:07.280
Let's also right click and choose two new layer and then we go.

02:07.280 --> 02:12.550
We can also select this white area around the can.

02:12.620 --> 02:17.090
I'll come over here to the Fuzzy's select tool and click in the white area.

02:17.090 --> 02:25.110
Now press commander control X and get rid of that de-select everything.

02:25.160 --> 02:26.990
Select none.

02:27.130 --> 02:30.710
And now maybe we can scale it down and get it in place.

02:30.720 --> 02:37.980
But let me drag it beneath the movies there first and then I'll scale it down.

02:38.180 --> 02:42.950
Let's get it a little bit smaller.

02:43.050 --> 02:44.680
Let's try that.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.550
Go to the move tool and get it in place.

02:49.300 --> 02:55.630
It looks like it's just a little bit skewed up and down so I can go back to my scale tool and click

02:55.630 --> 03:06.810
on the image and I will and these on link these and just move them a bit up and down.

03:06.810 --> 03:08.400
All right well let's give that a try.

03:08.400 --> 03:14.880
I'll go ahead and create a new layer here for the other part of the can the bottom of the can create

03:14.880 --> 03:22.770
a new layer here come over and choose our ellipse tool and press shift and click and drag and let's

03:22.770 --> 03:26.970
try and drag this over our circle here.

03:28.980 --> 03:40.120
And I'll move it into place something like this kind of squish it a bit so it just encompasses that

03:41.100 --> 03:43.120
part of the map.

03:44.210 --> 03:52.700
Then I'll come over to my color picker select the can top layer and pick a color off of there and I'll

03:52.700 --> 03:59.990
come back over to my paint bucket tool switch back to that layer with the selection on it and click

03:59.990 --> 04:07.590
there and that'll fill that circular selection up seems like it could be a little more silver.

04:07.610 --> 04:11.020
Let me drag this over just a bit.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.580
See if we can get it to be a little more gray.

04:14.400 --> 04:16.250
And then paint it again.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.410
Yeah I'll go with that.

04:18.420 --> 04:25.080
So this is the this layer here is our Can top.

04:25.530 --> 04:35.180
This is our Can bottom I'll create a new layer for the background.

04:35.180 --> 04:37.560
Drag that down to the bottom.

04:38.410 --> 04:40.490
Switch this back to black.

04:40.770 --> 04:42.770
Let's use the paint bucket tool.

04:42.930 --> 04:45.280
And if I come over here and try and click I can't click.

04:45.280 --> 04:51.610
I need to de-select that circular selection so I go to select none.

04:51.880 --> 04:57.430
And now I can come over here in an empty part of the image and click and that'll lay the black down

04:57.430 --> 04:58.370
there.

04:58.420 --> 05:07.120
So now I'll turn off that U.V. map and there is our image I'll press shift command J to see at full

05:07.120 --> 05:08.490
screen there.

05:08.500 --> 05:18.520
All right so let's export this now or go to file export as an instead of beer can you go ahead and change

05:18.520 --> 05:25.030
this to a beer can underscore see for color map and I'll export this out.

05:25.030 --> 05:27.550
So now let's go back to blender and apply our texture.
