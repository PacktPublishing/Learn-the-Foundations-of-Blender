00:00.720 --> 00:08.100
All right here in Gamp we're going to bring in our exported U-V map and lay a few textures down on it

00:08.100 --> 00:11.120
so we can import them back into blender.

00:11.190 --> 00:16.820
So if you haven't used it before you can find it here at Gip dot org.

00:16.830 --> 00:17.910
It's open source.

00:17.910 --> 00:22.640
It's free and it's available for just about any operating system.

00:22.650 --> 00:33.210
So let's go ahead and bring in our U-V map or go to File Open and I will browse to my project and other

00:33.210 --> 00:34.380
textures.

00:34.380 --> 00:39.520
Here is my door open that up are U-V.

00:39.520 --> 00:43.120
Map is represented by these shaded islands.

00:43.240 --> 00:50.110
We can put images underneath this layer and we'll still be able to see them and place them where we

00:50.110 --> 00:51.640
need them to be.

00:51.670 --> 00:58.760
So I'll go ahead and come up to file and open and let's find a texture we want to use.

00:58.840 --> 01:09.850
I have a texture folder with lots of textures here that we could maybe use I'm thinking this would texture

01:09.850 --> 01:10.450
right here.

01:10.460 --> 01:16.900
It's a seamless texture which means we should be able to tile it or put it in the end and the seams

01:16.960 --> 01:19.600
should be practically invisible.

01:19.750 --> 01:21.340
So let's give this a try.

01:21.340 --> 01:26.030
Click open and there it is.

01:26.230 --> 01:29.970
I'll select everything with control or command a.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.520
I will copy it.

01:31.540 --> 01:39.580
Go to edit copy and then I'll come over here and paste it here with edit paste.

01:40.790 --> 01:44.690
Now when it comes in you'll have this floating selection.

01:44.690 --> 01:51.890
We can right click on that and click two new layer and that will create a new layer that we can edit

01:52.040 --> 01:53.290
and modify.

01:53.330 --> 01:57.010
I'll zoom out a bit and here is the outline of our texture.

01:57.870 --> 02:05.420
I want to drag this down below the UVA's layer so we're seeing it through the I'll come over here to

02:05.420 --> 02:08.810
the rotate tool and the lips.

02:09.050 --> 02:19.220
Click on the image and type in 9 0 and click rotate and now click the scale tool.

02:19.340 --> 02:26.720
Click over here on the image and I want to make sure that my height and width are linked together so

02:26.720 --> 02:28.170
when I click that.

02:28.370 --> 02:34.520
And then I'll come over here to one of these corners and click and drag and bring this down to about

02:34.520 --> 02:39.700
the size or width of one of these U-V islands.

02:39.710 --> 02:48.080
I'll hit enter then I'll come over to the move tool here and click and drag and try and put it in place.

02:49.440 --> 03:00.120
And when you go hit the Z key to zoom in and once again the scale tool click and I'll bring this down

03:00.120 --> 03:03.890
just a bit and tell it's the width of that U-V Island.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.670
Go.

03:07.390 --> 03:16.000
Now I'd like to duplicate this layer and drag it down so shift command d press the end key for the move

03:16.000 --> 03:25.900
tool and bring this down I'll zoom in so I can take a look at the edges here and I should be able just

03:25.900 --> 03:35.080
to if I go to move to I can just press the arrow keys and kind of nudge the image into place I'll press

03:35.140 --> 03:43.810
shift command J to zoom out again shift command d to duplicate again and this time with the move tool

03:43.860 --> 03:52.030
selected I can hold the shift key down and press the down arrow and that'll move that all the way down

03:52.030 --> 03:53.210
there.

03:54.070 --> 04:05.450
And now I can just use the individual arrow key with out the shift key and nudge it into place and I

04:05.450 --> 04:10.090
would go zoom back out with shift command J.

04:10.460 --> 04:19.670
Now I will hide the use of these layer and merge these together with right click and merge visible layers

04:20.090 --> 04:21.950
and merge.

04:22.020 --> 04:26.400
And now I can take that one layer and duplicate it again.

04:27.270 --> 04:32.480
So I can also right click over here and choose duplicate layer.

04:32.740 --> 04:40.600
And now I can move this one over so I'll go back to the moved tool and shift to an arrow and move that

04:40.600 --> 04:43.600
over right about there.

04:44.820 --> 04:52.950
And it looks like we'll need one more duplicate shift arrow and move these over here.

04:54.510 --> 05:03.090
OK so now that we have our wood texture in let's now make room for the texture of the door handle We

05:03.090 --> 05:08.640
need to erase the areas over the door handle so I'll zoom in with the Z key.

05:08.640 --> 05:19.090
Here come over to the rectangular select tool click and drag this area and then I'll press command X

05:20.200 --> 05:22.500
I'll zoom out again shift command.

05:22.560 --> 05:34.550
Jay zoom in appere do the same thing click the rectangular select tool again drag a selection control

05:34.640 --> 05:36.390
or command X.

05:36.540 --> 05:37.520
Here we go.

05:38.300 --> 05:43.100
Now I want to de-selected this area go to select none.

05:43.160 --> 05:53.530
And now let's bring in some sort of a brass texture to put on the door knobs or go to File Open and

05:53.530 --> 06:01.660
in here and my textures folder I'll grab this brass image here and I can just click and drag this straight

06:01.660 --> 06:09.210
in right there and it'll create a new layer for me right into layer stack click Cancel.

06:09.410 --> 06:14.850
I click the scale tool click on the image and scale it down quite a bit.

06:17.230 --> 06:23.390
Hit scale and then I'll press the key and move it over here like that.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.210
So it encompasses this area.

06:26.210 --> 06:32.150
This group of islands Let me zoom in and make sure I have everything there.

06:32.270 --> 06:33.280
It looks like I do.

06:33.280 --> 06:34.110
OK.

06:34.510 --> 06:37.240
So now what I need to do is duplicate this

06:40.250 --> 06:42.640
and move it down to here.

06:44.410 --> 06:45.480
There we go.

06:45.970 --> 06:53.500
Well now take these brass layers and drag them down beneath the wood like that and I could also

06:56.240 --> 07:06.630
take these two and merge these together merge visible layers right there and I could do the same with

07:06.630 --> 07:08.250
the wood as well.

07:08.280 --> 07:14.340
Why not merge these together to.

07:14.350 --> 07:20.560
All right so now I have my door knob Lehre and my wood layer.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.700
This would work OK.

07:21.700 --> 07:24.490
But I think I want to clean it up just a little bit.

07:25.410 --> 07:29.140
So to do that I'm going to select that UVA's layer.

07:29.170 --> 07:37.050
I'll come over to the fuzzy selection tool and I'll click anywhere outside of a U-V island that will

07:37.050 --> 07:39.730
select everything outside the U-V islands.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.150
I'll zoom in so we can see this here.

07:42.420 --> 07:52.620
And we go now or come over to select and shrink and I'm going to shrink this selection by say two pixels

07:53.270 --> 08:00.270
I'll click OK and you can see how it's kind of expanded out beyond the U-V islands.

08:00.270 --> 08:06.240
I'm just trying to give it a little bit of room to breathe there and I'll press shift command Jay to

08:06.600 --> 08:16.550
zoom back out or click on the wood layer and press command X and that deletes everything on the wood

08:16.550 --> 08:23.050
layer and then I'll click on the brass lever and press command X and that deletes everything there as

08:23.050 --> 08:23.610
well.

08:24.830 --> 08:35.330
Now I'll add a new layer by going to Leyre new layer and I'll put this on on the bottom and grab my

08:35.390 --> 08:41.750
paint bucket tool and since my color is black here I'll go ahead and leave it at that and I'll click

08:41.750 --> 08:47.650
anywhere and fill in the background in black.

08:47.660 --> 08:52.920
Now there we have our color map for our door.

08:53.050 --> 08:58.900
Now we just need to export it out or go to file export as.

08:59.470 --> 09:01.510
And I'll call this door

09:04.190 --> 09:07.400
underscore C for color map.

09:07.400 --> 09:09.500
I'll make sure I have a p n g image.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.510
That's a pretty good format to use here.

09:12.860 --> 09:18.340
And our Click export.

09:18.350 --> 09:19.120
All right.

09:19.220 --> 09:25.690
So in the next video we'll go back to Blendr and apply our new texture to our object.
