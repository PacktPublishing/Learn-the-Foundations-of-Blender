WEBVTT

00:00.660 --> 00:05.390
So now let's work on a slightly different object this beer can here.

00:05.730 --> 00:14.100
What I'd like it to look like let me come back over here and create a new window and create a U.V. image

00:14.100 --> 00:22.650
editor and I'll bring in an image that I'd like this to ultimately be something like this.

00:22.810 --> 00:29.750
We can see we've got some chrome or metal material down at the bottom here and up at the top and then

00:29.750 --> 00:32.970
we've got the label of the can here.

00:33.110 --> 00:40.640
So to get that label on there we're going to need to use the map or object to lay it flat once again

00:40.820 --> 00:42.450
and apply that texture.

00:42.680 --> 00:54.210
Now the texture I'd like to apply is this one here so I've found this out on google images and it matches

00:54.210 --> 00:57.270
pretty well to the image here of the beer can.

00:57.270 --> 01:02.070
It's just one year off in terms of the Super Bowl and the date.

01:02.070 --> 01:09.860
In addition I have some images of the tops of cans we could use one of these for the top.

01:09.900 --> 01:17.700
But before we can do any of that we need to U-V map this so I'll switch over to my U-V editing screen

01:17.840 --> 01:18.960
lay.

01:19.100 --> 01:25.990
I'll go ahead and pull this window down and switch it over to node Ed. The way we've done before.

01:26.370 --> 01:33.980
And for this I'll tab into edit mode and the first thing I'll do is split out the top and the bottom

01:33.990 --> 01:42.320
so I think from what I could tell it looks like we could mark a scene here with control E and Mark.

01:42.660 --> 01:50.630
And also we could mark a seam down here maybe this one control key and Mark seam.

01:50.760 --> 02:02.490
Now we need to split that label out so it will lay flat press alt and click this edge here and we'll

02:02.490 --> 02:07.480
go ahead and de-select the edges along the top here.

02:07.500 --> 02:10.470
We don't need these.

02:10.480 --> 02:11.670
There we go.

02:12.060 --> 02:15.230
And all de-select the edges down here as well.

02:15.510 --> 02:24.250
To do that I can hit the C key and then middle mouse button click and drag to de-select those edges.

02:25.340 --> 02:34.030
All press control E and Mark seam and now we have the seams of our object marked and ready to go.

02:34.030 --> 02:41.060
One thing I'll do before I unwrap it is press control a and I'll go ahead and apply this scale.

02:41.260 --> 02:49.020
And now Alt-Tab into Edit Mode hit a and you and unwrap and there we go.

02:49.060 --> 02:52.000
Now this is a little bit curved here.

02:52.090 --> 02:56.530
The image I have is very rectangular and straight.

02:56.530 --> 02:59.400
This is not quite what I'd want.

02:59.410 --> 03:07.960
I can try switching from angle based to conformal and see if that helps switch that here.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.860
And that helps a good deal.

03:10.880 --> 03:19.250
We're still fighting against this area here that curves in and that's just the nature of this particular

03:19.370 --> 03:20.260
object.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.500
So what can we do about this.

03:22.820 --> 03:28.970
Well we can come over here and I'm going to go ahead and select just this object with the U-V Island

03:29.000 --> 03:36.290
selection mode and I'm going to go to full screen here all press control up arrows so we can see it

03:36.500 --> 03:38.090
full screen.

03:38.090 --> 03:47.160
I'll rotate it with our 9:0 and that didn't work so I'll hit escape and press are negative 9:0.

03:47.630 --> 03:49.770
And that did a little better.

03:50.280 --> 03:58.550
I'll move this to one side to work on it and zoom in some what I'd like to do is make these edges perfectly

03:58.550 --> 04:07.340
straight so I can use the tools under this Uvas menu right up here under weld line and I can use these

04:07.470 --> 04:09.920
line x and y.

04:09.950 --> 04:13.640
Notice that the shortcut key is the W key.

04:13.760 --> 04:21.650
If I switch over here to edge select click on this edge right here I'll press alt and then click on

04:21.650 --> 04:23.810
it just like that whole edge.

04:23.810 --> 04:31.770
Now I can press w and align Y and that straightens that whole edge out.

04:31.780 --> 04:36.430
So now let's see if I can do that for these other edges as well.

04:36.430 --> 04:46.510
I'll select this one here w and if you look real close you can see that the short cut for a line Y is

04:46.510 --> 04:47.350
the key.

04:47.350 --> 04:48.880
So I'll just hit.

04:49.240 --> 04:54.920
And that will straighten that edge up once again Allt w I.

04:55.240 --> 04:56.670
And I'll do those up here.

04:56.740 --> 04:59.920
Alt WSI Alt.

04:59.920 --> 05:01.360
Click.

05:01.370 --> 05:08.470
W-why and I'll just keep doing that for every horizontal edge.

05:08.470 --> 05:10.400
And lastly one more up here.

05:10.720 --> 05:11.770
W and.

05:12.790 --> 05:13.150
All right.

05:13.150 --> 05:16.810
So I have all the horizontal edges in line.

05:16.870 --> 05:21.300
Now I need to do the vertical so I'll press alt and click an edge here.

05:21.520 --> 05:25.920
Press the W key and for the align x.

05:25.930 --> 05:29.150
The shortcut key is l.

05:29.350 --> 05:34.770
So I'll hit L and that will align that vertical edge straight up and down.

05:34.760 --> 05:43.210
So Allt click W.L. alt click W.L. and I'll go through and do all of these as well.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.400
And one more here.

05:47.470 --> 05:56.740
OK so now we have that whole area straightened up and aligned all press control up arrow and we can

05:56.740 --> 06:00.300
click on the stretch here to see if we have any stretching.

06:00.450 --> 06:01.830
Not bad.

06:01.830 --> 06:06.480
We've got some here but I don't think this is going to be a problem because this isn't going to have

06:06.480 --> 06:12.300
any text applied to it or anything it's going to be a uniform metallic color.

06:12.600 --> 06:15.600
So I think we should be fine with this.

06:15.870 --> 06:24.420
Now go ahead and select all of the U-V islands with the achy press control a and press control.

06:24.750 --> 06:29.710
Now I'd like to rotate these so the label is aligned horizontally.

06:29.760 --> 06:33.320
Uncheck this and there we go.

06:33.530 --> 06:42.370
Maybe I'll take the margin from point 0 0 1 to point 1 to spread those out just a little bit.

06:42.800 --> 06:45.160
And even so that may still be a little snug.

06:45.170 --> 06:53.750
So I'll select the U-V Island selection mode and move these out just a little bit give them some room

06:53.750 --> 06:54.600
to breathe.

06:55.830 --> 06:56.210
All right.

06:56.220 --> 06:59.490
And there we go we've got our U-V map done.

06:59.730 --> 07:06.540
Let's go ahead and assign that U-V grid test pattern just to make sure we're doing all right.

07:07.020 --> 07:15.780
So to create a new test grid texture I'll click on new and I'll call this U-V test and I'll change the

07:15.780 --> 07:24.560
generated type to U-V grid and I'll go ahead and leave it at 10:24 by 10:24 and click OK.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.240
And there it is.

07:26.250 --> 07:32.360
Now let's come up here and create a material that we can apply that new texture to create new and I'll

07:32.470 --> 07:35.810
call this material U-V test as well.

07:36.240 --> 07:47.250
I'll press shift A and bring in an image texture node and now we can pull this menu down and select

07:47.250 --> 07:49.290
our U-V test grid.

07:49.290 --> 07:55.900
Now come over here and change our viewport shading to textured and there we are.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.310
Let's take a look at it.

07:58.740 --> 08:01.120
It doesn't look too bad actually.

08:01.350 --> 08:02.920
The top looks good.

08:03.210 --> 08:10.320
The bottom looks good and all the checkers on the sides look square and uniform.

08:10.530 --> 08:11.880
I think that looks pretty good.

08:12.990 --> 08:14.430
All right.

08:14.430 --> 08:22.110
So now we can take this U-V map and export it out and take it into gimp just like we did before.

08:22.140 --> 08:26.630
Click Uvas export U-V lay out.

08:26.630 --> 08:34.260
I'll go ahead and choose 10:24 by 10:24 this time I'll put it in my textures folder and I'll call this

08:34.260 --> 08:41.500
one beer can underscore Uvas and there it goes.

08:41.940 --> 08:45.880
So now let's once again open it up and get up and lay the textures out.
