00:00.890 --> 00:08.390
So we've talked about the importance of making sure that our U-V map isn't stretching the texture because

00:08.420 --> 00:15.680
any stretching of this test pattern here is telling us that any other texture we put down on this is

00:15.770 --> 00:17.500
also going to be stretched.

00:17.570 --> 00:26.360
So if we're putting down a brick texture or concrete texture or actually words on the object it would

00:26.360 --> 00:30.730
be very obvious if the texture was stretched and we wouldn't want that.

00:31.040 --> 00:37.280
So in addition to making sure our textures aren't stretched we also need to make sure that there aren't

00:37.310 --> 00:39.570
any unnecessary seams.

00:39.680 --> 00:48.950
So if we take a look at this texture here you can see that as the checker pattern wraps around the object

00:49.310 --> 00:57.260
there's a break there that texture isn't continuous from one side to the other maybe depending on what

00:57.260 --> 01:05.240
this object is in our scene we need that texture to wrap smoothly around the object without a visible

01:05.250 --> 01:06.830
seam so.

01:06.860 --> 01:13.840
Another thing we need to be mindful of when U-V mapping is where to place our seams.

01:14.150 --> 01:22.670
So let's say we wanted this texture to wrap seamlessly along the edge there we could use Blender's Mark

01:22.670 --> 01:30.170
seam tool to tell Blendr where to cut the object where to cut the seams so that the important parts

01:30.170 --> 01:32.410
of the texture are seamless.

01:32.450 --> 01:39.950
So I'll change over to edge view and then I'll begin marking a few seem so I'll select an edge.

01:39.950 --> 01:42.530
There may be one there.

01:43.660 --> 01:48.420
Go on around the object like this.

01:48.420 --> 01:54.460
So I'll just kind of mark those seams here with those edges selected I'll press control.

01:55.020 --> 01:59.430
And I'll choose Mark seam from the edges menu.

01:59.430 --> 02:05.490
Now you can see that there's these red lines telling us that these are where our seems are going to

02:05.490 --> 02:06.120
be.

02:06.180 --> 02:09.450
All right so now I'll select everything with the a key.

02:09.450 --> 02:10.740
I'll press you again.

02:10.740 --> 02:17.870
And instead of choosing smart U-V project allowing Blendr to choose where to put the seams.

02:17.970 --> 02:25.010
I'm going to choose unwrap and have Blendr use my choices as to where the seams should be.

02:25.020 --> 02:28.490
So I click unwrap and there we go.

02:28.510 --> 02:35.140
Now we see a very different pattern for our U-V islands and less time about of edit mode and take a

02:35.140 --> 02:36.200
look at this.

02:36.370 --> 02:44.280
Notice now I was able to get that Checker pattern to wrap seamlessly around the object.

02:44.830 --> 02:53.020
So U-V mapping can often be a strategic exercise in that you're trying to figure out what is the least

02:53.200 --> 02:55.910
prominent place to put a seam.

02:56.170 --> 03:02.980
Where does the texture need to be seamless and where can I hide a seam so it won't be distracting from

03:02.980 --> 03:03.640
the viewer.

03:04.910 --> 03:12.860
Now I should also say that the U-V unwrapping process should be done at the end of the modeling process.

03:12.860 --> 03:20.120
Once you've established your U-V map you shouldn't be doing any more modeling.

03:20.120 --> 03:21.860
Here let me show you what I mean.

03:22.040 --> 03:31.610
If we tab into edit mode and go to face mode I'll select this face and I'll extrude it up.

03:31.620 --> 03:34.180
Now take a look at what's going on here.

03:34.230 --> 03:41.610
If we select our entire object the U.V. map hasn't changed any but since our object has changed the

03:41.610 --> 03:47.070
U.V. map is no longer representative of our 3D object.

03:47.400 --> 03:54.300
So now that I've changed my 3D model I'm going to have to go back and reuse the map the object.

03:54.300 --> 04:01.920
So if I take a look at this again I can see that these seams we're just split when I extruded these

04:01.920 --> 04:03.100
up.

04:03.180 --> 04:12.300
So what I can do is go back to edge mode and select these edges here and press control easy and clear

04:12.300 --> 04:23.030
those seams and now select these edges to connect those seams back up control the mark seam and now

04:25.340 --> 04:33.320
if I select everything press you and unwrap you can see that I've re-established that proper relationship

04:33.680 --> 04:38.020
between the U-V map and the 3D object.

04:38.060 --> 04:47.000
Now our textures are unstretched and at least in some places hopefully the important places the seams

04:47.150 --> 04:48.670
are hidden.

04:48.680 --> 04:51.260
Now there's one more thing you need to watch out for.

04:51.470 --> 04:58.310
Not only in terms of extruding and inserting edge loops and things like that but you also need to watch

04:58.310 --> 05:00.110
out for scaling.

05:00.110 --> 05:09.430
So let's say I had this object and I scaled it in Object mode in the Z-axis something like this pretty

05:09.430 --> 05:10.930
tall Let's do that.

05:11.700 --> 05:19.770
Now let me go back into edit mode and hit you and unwrap and look it up here.

05:19.770 --> 05:22.670
It says object has nonuniform scale.

05:22.740 --> 05:27.730
Unwrap will operate in a non scaled version of the mesh.

05:27.780 --> 05:36.530
So what that's telling you is that the U-V unwrap doesn't match with the particular scale of the object.

05:36.540 --> 05:45.180
So if I hit the end key to bring up the properties panel over on the right and I tab into object mode

05:45.840 --> 05:51.160
you can see that the scale is five point three and I've got one and one for the x and y.

05:51.240 --> 05:59.190
This is nonuniform because all of these are not ones to be uniform they would all need to be ones to

05:59.190 --> 05:59.750
do that.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.690
I can apply the scale to this object as it is now.

06:03.840 --> 06:05.970
So I'll press control a.

06:06.060 --> 06:11.960
And now with the Apply transforms menu I can choose scale.

06:11.990 --> 06:15.280
Now my scale over here is all ones.

06:15.470 --> 06:26.060
If I tab back into edit mode and press you and unwrap now are U.V. unwrap is in proportion to the scale

06:26.060 --> 06:27.670
of our 3D object.

06:28.100 --> 06:35.090
So not only should you be doing your U-V unwrapping after the model is completely done you should also

06:35.090 --> 06:41.790
be mindful that the scale needs to be uniform to get the U-V islands to really represent the 3D object.

06:41.810 --> 06:45.290
And as it is in terms of proportion and scale.
