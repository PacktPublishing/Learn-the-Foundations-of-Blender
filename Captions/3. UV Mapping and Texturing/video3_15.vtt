00:00.750 --> 00:07.680
So since the last video I've gone ahead and changed the mix R.G. be known here to overlay.

00:07.680 --> 00:13.020
And I think I'm getting a nicer mix between the two textures here.

00:13.020 --> 00:16.250
I like the way we can see the creases there.

00:16.260 --> 00:24.780
Now if I wanted to emphasize those creases a little bit more I could use a bump map and a map is nothing

00:24.780 --> 00:32.910
more than a black and white image a greyscale image in which Blender's sees the white parts of the image

00:33.000 --> 00:38.270
as something to push out and the black parts as something to pull in.

00:38.340 --> 00:44.940
So medium gray in the image is just flat white pushes out black pulls in.

00:44.940 --> 00:52.440
So what we can try is we could try and take this image here convert it to a black and white image and

00:52.650 --> 00:58.460
the lighter parts will appear to push out and the darker parts will appear to push in.

00:58.860 --> 01:00.540
So let's give that a try.

01:01.050 --> 01:04.960
So here's that image of the painted shading here.

01:05.220 --> 01:13.650
What I'll do is first of all convert the color to black and white so I'll press shift A and go to converter

01:14.100 --> 01:21.930
and choose an R G B to black and white so will want to convert it first and then we're going to take

01:21.930 --> 01:28.170
that value coming out of that G B node into the material output.

01:28.170 --> 01:32.590
So I'm going to press control up arrow just so we can see this a little bit better.

01:32.730 --> 01:37.790
And notice I've tried to match the color of the sockets for each of the nodes.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.740
The color is the yellow sockets.

01:40.740 --> 01:45.930
This BSD to the material output is green.

01:45.930 --> 01:52.980
I've got a yellow socket here so I can take this and drag it and connect it to here.

01:52.980 --> 01:59.190
Now here I have a gray socket a value and that can go straight into the displacement.

01:59.190 --> 02:05.740
But if I do that I'm not going to have any way to control the strength of the bump so to do that lets

02:05.820 --> 02:10.240
press shift A and bring in a math node.

02:10.560 --> 02:14.970
And with this I can change it to multiply.

02:14.970 --> 02:24.000
And now I can use the value of this node to adjust the strength of the displacement so I'll connect

02:24.000 --> 02:30.570
this value to here and this value to this great socket here.

02:30.600 --> 02:33.430
All right so I'll press control up arrow again.

02:33.950 --> 02:35.550
And let's take a look at what's happened here.

02:35.550 --> 02:38.410
We can see just a little bit of a difference here.

02:38.430 --> 02:46.680
Now I'm in the rendered viewport shading and we can see just a bit of a difference if I click and drag

02:46.680 --> 02:49.870
this a little higher lets drag it way up.

02:50.070 --> 02:57.570
We can see that the dark parts here on our image are being pushed in and the brighter parts are being

02:57.600 --> 02:58.690
pushed out.

02:59.100 --> 03:00.840
So that's a little bit too much.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.830
Let's take it down to maybe 1.0 and see how that works.

03:04.830 --> 03:12.270
That's pretty good but it's still a little bit too much I think I'll take it down to maybe point eight.

03:12.300 --> 03:17.020
Let's try that yeah I think that's looking pretty good.

03:17.040 --> 03:23.170
It's giving the sense that this bag has some creases and folds in it.

03:23.430 --> 03:28.590
And here let me pull this off so you can see the difference I'll pull that off.

03:28.590 --> 03:35.850
And now you can see that before which is pretty good with just the paint going through into the color.

03:35.850 --> 03:42.400
Now add this back and we can see we get just a little bit more of a bump there.

03:42.420 --> 03:42.780
All right.

03:42.780 --> 03:47.660
Well let's do that to the wood paneling back here if I select the wall.

03:47.670 --> 03:51.840
Now here's our no tree for the wall.

03:51.840 --> 04:01.770
If I did the same thing here I can press shift A and bring in a R.G. be too black and white node and

04:01.770 --> 04:04.560
I'll bring in a math node.

04:04.980 --> 04:14.130
I'll change the math no to multiply and now connect these up color to color or yellow socket to yellow

04:14.130 --> 04:19.670
socket and the value to the value here.

04:19.820 --> 04:25.190
Now let's take a look at the wall we currently have it at point five if I click and drag that way up

04:25.190 --> 04:28.430
you can see that's that's a bit too much.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.200
But you can see the effect that it's having.

04:32.210 --> 04:35.170
I'll take it down to maybe one point though again.

04:35.180 --> 04:37.130
Let's see how that works.

04:37.670 --> 04:43.950
Yeah that looks pretty good it gives a little bit of displacement to the image so it feels like there's

04:43.970 --> 04:45.610
some texture there.

04:45.620 --> 04:55.000
Once again I'll just click this out so you can see the difference there is before and after.

04:55.220 --> 05:01.670
So being able to add a little bit of bump is really helpful to giving the image a little bit more texture.

05:01.670 --> 05:05.570
All right so let's say we have our image the way we want it.

05:05.570 --> 05:08.520
Now let's go ahead and render this out.

05:08.750 --> 05:12.610
I'll go back to the render panel here.

05:12.890 --> 05:19.730
Make sure that my render resolution is at 100 percent I'll take a look at my sampling.

05:19.880 --> 05:24.130
And currently my Rynders sample is at 128.

05:24.260 --> 05:25.190
That may not be bad.

05:25.190 --> 05:28.990
We can try it here and see how it looks.

05:29.030 --> 05:34.150
I'll come up here and I'll click render and here it goes.

05:34.170 --> 05:41.670
Now if you'd like to learn more about rendering and lighting and materials please check out Blendr 201

05:41.760 --> 05:49.600
introduction to materials and lighting here at Blendr 101 dot com and there is our final rendered image.

05:49.610 --> 05:54.030
I'll go ahead and come down here to image and save as image.

05:54.110 --> 05:56.600
And now I can save it here to my hard drive.

05:56.600 --> 06:07.140
I'll call this flour sack and I'll save it as a PNB.

06:07.150 --> 06:08.200
There we go.

06:08.700 --> 06:13.460
Well I hope this introduction to U-V mapping and texturing has been helpful for you.

06:13.470 --> 06:15.090
I've certainly enjoyed it.

06:15.120 --> 06:20.070
And please check out the other great blender tutorials here at Blender 101 dot com.

06:20.370 --> 06:22.320
Well thanks again and take care.
