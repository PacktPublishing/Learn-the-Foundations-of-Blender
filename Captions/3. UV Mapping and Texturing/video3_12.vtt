00:00.740 --> 00:07.130
Now that we've added a little bit of paint onto our object here we could take it off as well by changing

00:07.130 --> 00:10.780
the blend mode from mix to subtract.

00:10.880 --> 00:15.510
And then if we just paint over this you can see it erases what we've done.

00:15.710 --> 00:22.850
Now we can do the same thing by pressing the control key and drawing as well.

00:22.850 --> 00:28.940
Notice that the strength is only at point seven if I drag it all the way up to 1 and hold control and

00:28.940 --> 00:29.800
drag.

00:29.900 --> 00:34.220
I can erase that whole thing to erase the rest of this a little easier.

00:34.220 --> 00:39.860
I should increase the size of the brush and to do that I can come over here to the radius and click

00:39.860 --> 00:46.880
and drag that up a bit and then I can hold control and click and begin erasing this.

00:46.880 --> 00:55.250
In addition I can tap the F key and change the size of the brush interactively and I can also change

00:55.250 --> 01:01.680
the strength of the brush by pressing shift F and moving the mouse in and out as well.

01:03.190 --> 01:10.630
So I'll just go ahead and race this stroke here with control and click and drag and now what I'd like

01:10.630 --> 01:19.050
to do is fill this whole object with a base color that's kind of like the color of that flour sack.

01:19.060 --> 01:24.910
So what I need to do is bring in the image of that flour sack to do that I'll come over here and change

01:24.910 --> 01:35.290
this view from a node editor to a U.V. Image Editor click on open image here and bring in that reference

01:35.290 --> 01:35.730
image.

01:35.770 --> 01:39.140
I have it in my images folder here.

01:39.370 --> 01:44.200
I'll click on this button right here so I can see them so I can see which one I want.

01:44.200 --> 01:50.680
And I think it's this flour sack for I'll open that up and there it is.

01:50.710 --> 01:55.480
Now it does have the U-V wires over the image.

01:55.510 --> 01:56.950
I don't really want that.

01:57.040 --> 02:05.500
What I can do is change from view to paint and then come over here to view and turn off draw texture

02:05.500 --> 02:06.670
paint.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.790
And then I just have the plain image.

02:09.790 --> 02:12.930
Now I'd like to sample one of these colors here.

02:13.150 --> 02:21.520
If I hold the key down and move the mouse around you can see hovering over the various colors in the

02:21.520 --> 02:22.320
image.

02:22.630 --> 02:29.350
I can click on one of the colors maybe say something like that and that will create a palette in which

02:29.350 --> 02:31.630
that color will be stored.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.780
Now it didn't change the color here.

02:33.790 --> 02:37.340
I need to click on that palette to change to that color.

02:37.810 --> 02:42.330
And now I can come over here and click and drag and paint on the object.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.790
However I need it on the whole object.

02:44.800 --> 02:51.670
And if I came through here and tried to click and drag I could do it I could paint on this whole thing

02:51.670 --> 02:54.920
and fill this entire object with that color.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.800
But it might take a while.

02:56.800 --> 03:05.590
So instead what I can do is come over here to the brush palettes here and choose the fill brush.

03:05.600 --> 03:13.140
Now once again I need to choose that palette color here and now if I click on the object it will fill

03:13.140 --> 03:14.370
that entire object.

03:14.580 --> 03:21.090
But it didn't fill it with quite the right color and the reason why is that the strength is only at

03:21.090 --> 03:22.070
point five.

03:22.080 --> 03:28.950
So we're seeing some of the black through the color I can bring that strength up again to one and click

03:28.950 --> 03:32.000
over here and that fills the whole thing.

03:32.370 --> 03:33.240
All right.

03:33.240 --> 03:37.920
So we have the bag at least filled now with a base color.

03:38.190 --> 03:42.210
I'll click the brush menu again and go back to my texture.

03:42.210 --> 03:43.710
Draw a brush.

03:43.710 --> 03:47.660
Notice that the Asterix is back here on the image menu.

03:47.730 --> 03:50.070
That means we haven't saved yet.

03:50.070 --> 03:56.730
So if I pressed control or command s to save the scene it's still there.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.600
It still hasn't been saved.

03:58.830 --> 04:07.500
What I need to do is save the image here or press alt s so I'll press alt s and there we go.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.150
Now it's been saved.

04:09.180 --> 04:16.320
So when texture painting and blender saving is a two step process control or command s to save the scene

04:16.830 --> 04:20.100
and Allt as to save the image.

04:20.100 --> 04:28.500
Now let's see if we can lay down a kind of burlap texture on our object as well to do that we'll need

04:28.500 --> 04:32.060
to bring in a texture for our brush.

04:32.070 --> 04:38.670
So first of all what I'll do is I'll drag open a new window over here and change this to a propertys

04:38.670 --> 04:39.420
window.

04:40.580 --> 04:47.160
Now over here in the materials panel we can see that here is our flour sack material.

04:47.360 --> 04:54.650
And in addition if we switch over to the texture panel we can see here under this pull down menu we

04:54.650 --> 04:57.290
have a texture setting for our brush.

04:57.410 --> 05:04.380
So I click that now in here we can create a new texture for our brush.

05:04.400 --> 05:08.450
Now this panel can also be seen right over here as well.

05:08.450 --> 05:12.140
So clicking new here is the same as clicking new here.

05:12.260 --> 05:19.880
If I click here you can see it created this black here which is the same as this black texture here.

05:22.140 --> 05:30.080
Now we can add procedural textures to this generated by Blendr or we can bring in images as well.

05:30.240 --> 05:32.840
And I have an image I'd like to try and use.

05:33.120 --> 05:41.480
So I'll come over here to the image section of my brush texture click open and I'll browse to that texture.

05:41.490 --> 05:42.220
Here it is here.

05:42.240 --> 05:49.750
I have a seamless image of burlap texture so I'll select that and click open image.

05:49.770 --> 05:53.360
Now that adds that to the image texture here.

05:53.460 --> 05:54.980
So let's give this a try.

05:54.990 --> 06:00.330
I'm going to bring the strength down just a little bit so it kind of mixes with that base color.

06:01.270 --> 06:09.190
And then I'll come over to my 3-D object and just click and drag that's not quite the effect I want

06:09.200 --> 06:19.010
so I'm going to undo that maybe take this down 2.5 and increase the brush size hit the F key and move

06:19.010 --> 06:24.810
the mouse a bit and now try painting like this.

06:24.990 --> 06:30.220
And that's a little more of the size of the texture that I was hoping for.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.270
Kind of like this.

06:32.760 --> 06:41.830
I'm going to undo that and if I zoom out you can see that the relative size of the brush now is is bigger.

06:41.850 --> 06:49.790
So I can click and drag and see now that burlap is going down onto the object quite a bit larger so

06:49.850 --> 06:52.430
this size in my frame I'll go ahead and try this.

06:52.430 --> 07:00.080
I will click and drag and move back and forth here and see how it's going to look and that's pretty

07:00.080 --> 07:01.220
good.

07:01.220 --> 07:07.070
The problem is is it didn't get all the way over here if I tried to then click and drag over here I

07:07.070 --> 07:14.230
would see an overlap over here you can see it here in the U-V image editor.

07:14.230 --> 07:21.850
So if I undo that perhaps what I should do is try and paint over here in the movie image editor and

07:21.850 --> 07:28.750
I'll just click and drag holding the mouse down so that we get a nice even texture.

07:28.750 --> 07:33.130
Now you can also use a pen and tablet for this.

07:33.130 --> 07:35.520
And I would recommend that as well.

07:36.540 --> 07:47.140
But for this I'll just go ahead and hold the mouse button down and lay that texture all across this

07:47.140 --> 07:49.780
particular U-V island.

07:49.780 --> 07:53.620
Now I'll go ahead and do the same thing for the U-V islands up here.

07:53.620 --> 07:57.640
Up top click and drag.

07:57.810 --> 08:06.630
So in this way you can paint tile texture so I have the tiled brush mapping selected here and lay a

08:06.630 --> 08:10.230
texture down over your entire object.

08:10.260 --> 08:16.010
The last thing I want to do is get some sort of label on the flour sack.

08:16.140 --> 08:22.380
So in the next video let's take a look at using the stencil feature in Blender's texture painting tools.
