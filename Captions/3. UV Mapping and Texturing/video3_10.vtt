WEBVTT

00:00.940 --> 00:09.010
Back in Blendr Let's go ahead and bring that image in back into object mode and create a whole new material

00:09.010 --> 00:18.700
for our can here call it beer can now bring in an image texture Noad here and I'll go ahead and connect

00:18.700 --> 00:27.460
it up and then bring in that image I'll go to my textures folder and here it is that beer can underscore

00:27.460 --> 00:28.190
see.

00:28.450 --> 00:31.110
I'll open it up and here it is.

00:31.180 --> 00:37.390
Now the main problem I see here is that this particular top this particular tab is just a little too

00:37.390 --> 00:38.470
big.

00:38.530 --> 00:41.030
It feels like it's too wide.

00:41.100 --> 00:48.030
So there are some adjustments that we can do here in blender in the U-V map so I'll tab back into edit

00:48.030 --> 00:53.670
mode and I'll select this piece right here.

00:54.150 --> 01:02.430
I'll change what we're seeing underneath the U.V. map by coming down here and selecting that beer can

01:02.570 --> 01:03.640
here.

01:03.930 --> 01:11.970
Now you can see that if we turn off our stretch we've got the images underneath our U-V map.

01:11.980 --> 01:17.530
What I'd like to do is try and scale this a bit to see if I can get it to be a little bit smaller on

01:17.650 --> 01:18.850
the object.

01:18.850 --> 01:22.380
I feel like that tab and the opening is just too big.

01:22.690 --> 01:26.210
So I'll hit the s key here and scale this down a bit.

01:26.210 --> 01:28.170
Now that's not going to work.

01:28.340 --> 01:32.030
But if I scale this up a bit like this.

01:32.120 --> 01:36.300
Well that helps with the size of the image.

01:36.580 --> 01:43.280
But now we can see that black bleeding over into the texture of our model.

01:43.360 --> 01:45.710
And we don't want that.

01:45.800 --> 01:54.770
So now that I feel like this is about the right size for our object what I need to do is come back and

01:54.890 --> 01:56.540
adjust this image.

01:56.540 --> 01:59.870
So it works a little better with our object.

01:59.990 --> 02:03.950
So I'll tab back into edit mode and I just want to move this.

02:03.950 --> 02:11.660
Now I'll hit the G key and the x key and I'll move it so it isn't overlapping the other circular image.

02:11.810 --> 02:16.830
And now I need to take this back into Gimp and adjust that image.

02:16.940 --> 02:26.510
So let's do that quickly I'll go to Uvas export image and I'll call this beer can you use to call it

02:27.470 --> 02:33.560
2 and export it out back here in Gamp I can go ahead and open that image up.

02:34.550 --> 02:36.270
Here's the movies too.

02:36.340 --> 02:44.990
I'll open it up here selected and copy it into our main document and there it is.

02:44.990 --> 02:48.000
All right click and choose two new layer.

02:48.050 --> 02:52.320
Now I can come in here and adjust the image a bit.

02:52.580 --> 03:01.700
So I'll go to my move to and with the arrow key I'll just nudge this over maybe press shift and arrow

03:01.700 --> 03:04.250
and nudge it over a bit.

03:04.370 --> 03:07.520
So it's kind of in the center of that U-V island.

03:07.580 --> 03:13.140
Now perhaps what I can do is take this piece here and duplicate it.

03:13.160 --> 03:18.890
So with this lair selected I'll press shift command D and that will duplicate the layer.

03:19.280 --> 03:21.780
And now I can go to my move tool.

03:21.890 --> 03:30.620
And once again with my arrow keys I can begin to move this over and slide it in underneath this piece

03:30.620 --> 03:31.530
right here.

03:31.970 --> 03:38.630
Looks like I'm gonna need to scale it up a bit and then I'll use the Move tool again just to try and

03:38.630 --> 03:39.990
get it into place.

03:40.430 --> 03:45.920
And it looks to me like it might be overlapping the beer can label.

03:45.980 --> 03:50.490
So what I can do is just take that and drag it down underneath the label.

03:50.720 --> 03:53.300
So it's hidden down beneath that.

03:53.330 --> 03:56.110
So let's export it and see how it looks.

03:57.580 --> 04:01.800
And now back in blender with this image texture node's selected.

04:01.810 --> 04:08.770
Now you just come over here to this button right here and reload that image from disk.

04:08.880 --> 04:09.500
And there we go.

04:09.500 --> 04:13.140
So now you can see we've taken care of that black.

04:13.320 --> 04:17.610
That was happening along the edge of the can top.

04:17.650 --> 04:24.100
Now the last thing I want to do is adjust this material so it looks a little better it looks a little

04:24.340 --> 04:26.760
shiny or more like metal.

04:27.040 --> 04:34.910
So I will bring in a glossy Shater and a mix note as well.

04:37.250 --> 04:40.000
And put those together.

04:40.070 --> 04:44.980
Now I need to set up my scene so I can see it in a render.

04:45.050 --> 04:51.350
The first thing I'll do is create a polygon play and I just want to have something that the can is sitting

04:51.350 --> 04:51.820
on.

04:52.880 --> 04:58.970
And another thing I'll do is duplicate this plane and bring it up.

05:00.030 --> 05:04.420
Maybe scale it down a bit and this is going to be our light.

05:04.540 --> 05:07.810
Now rotate it around the x axis just a bit.

05:08.750 --> 05:15.580
And now we can create an emission material for this object and have it be a light.

05:15.770 --> 05:19.100
So I click new call this light

05:21.890 --> 05:23.490
right up here in the node Ed..

05:23.490 --> 05:32.650
I'm going to grab this tab and pull out a new window and make this Properties window right here and

05:32.650 --> 05:41.360
now I can choose my material and I can change my diffuse node here from diffuse to emission.

05:41.740 --> 05:46.260
I'll change from textured viewport shading to rendered.

05:47.200 --> 05:52.000
I'll zoom in here and here is what we have so far.

05:52.000 --> 05:59.530
Now I can change the strength of the emission node here say bring it up to 3 and that brightens up the

05:59.530 --> 06:00.840
scene quite a bit.

06:01.330 --> 06:03.890
But we're getting a little too much shine off of the can.

06:03.890 --> 06:10.990
Here I'll select the cam and I can bring that mix shader down so it's bringing in more of the diffuse

06:11.080 --> 06:13.720
material than the glossy.

06:13.780 --> 06:19.720
But the challenge of creating a metal material oftentimes isn't the settings itself.

06:19.720 --> 06:22.900
It's actually what the metal is reflecting.

06:22.900 --> 06:28.000
Currently there isn't anything for the metal to reflect.

06:28.120 --> 06:36.070
We're just seeing this gray background reflected in the can what we can do is bring in an HDR image

06:36.520 --> 06:43.890
an image in the background here that will help us gauge how the reflections are working on our material.

06:44.350 --> 06:50.590
So to do that let's come over here in this property window that I've kind of squeezed into the node

06:50.710 --> 06:55.240
window and hit the end key to close that panel up.

06:55.240 --> 07:01.890
But over here in the Properties window what let's do is come over to the world settings and click on

07:01.900 --> 07:03.620
use nodes.

07:03.640 --> 07:11.060
Now if we come over to the world settings here and take a look at the nodes for the world here it is.

07:11.620 --> 07:19.420
We can now bring in an image for our background I'll press shift a and a good texture and instead of

07:19.420 --> 07:26.230
bringing in an image texture I'm going to bring in an environment texture so I'll click that and I'll

07:26.230 --> 07:31.540
open it up and bring in an image I have here of an apartment.

07:31.690 --> 07:38.210
Click Open and now are connected to the back ground node.

07:38.650 --> 07:45.550
Now if we zoom out we can see heres the whole apartment projected in our background.

07:45.550 --> 07:53.930
Now I can zoom in and we can begin to see as a reflection some of that apartment in our material.

07:53.950 --> 08:03.880
So let me just go back to our object nodes and if I take this mix shader all the way up to the glossy

08:04.630 --> 08:07.690
you can begin to see some of the reflections in the can.

08:07.780 --> 08:11.410
Now take the roughness of the glossy down to zero here.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.330
And now you can really see it its almost like a mirror.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.640
So I dont think we need it quite that shiny.

08:19.660 --> 08:22.180
Maybe I'll take the roughness back.

08:22.180 --> 08:34.400
Point one is try that up point 0 5 and then bring the mic shader down something like this.

08:34.470 --> 08:37.030
Maybe we'll take it down to Point three.

08:38.260 --> 08:38.860
So there we go.

08:38.860 --> 08:45.260
Now we've got some of that reflection happening in our can.

08:45.330 --> 08:48.020
So now we've taken a look at U.V. mapping.

08:48.020 --> 08:55.890
A couple of objects taking that U-V map out to Gimp and creating an image texture for it.

08:55.890 --> 09:03.090
We then brought it in and combine that image texture with some material settings within blender.

09:03.090 --> 09:08.660
Now what let's do is let's take a look at texturing completely in Blender.

09:08.670 --> 09:15.240
We'll look at some of Blender's texture painting tools and how we can save out and bake our textures

09:15.450 --> 09:20.190
to be used here in blender and in external programs like the unity game engine.
