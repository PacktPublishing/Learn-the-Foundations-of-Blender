00:00.930 --> 00:08.130
Now let's take a look at how we can use the stencil feature to add a label to our flour sack in Gimp.

00:08.130 --> 00:14.180
I've gone ahead and brought up an image that I'd like to use for the logo here.

00:14.390 --> 00:23.130
I'll press shift command J to zoom in and what I need to do is remove the white from this image and

00:23.130 --> 00:30.330
have an alpha channel or transparency around the letters to do that I'll come over here to the layer

00:30.360 --> 00:34.590
and right click and I'll choose an alpha channel.

00:34.830 --> 00:41.760
And now that I've done that that will allow me to erase the white if I come over here to the erase tool

00:41.760 --> 00:46.730
and I can click and drag here you can see now we can see through that area.

00:46.920 --> 00:53.820
So to make things a little quicker I'll choose the fuzzy select tool and click out here in the white

00:54.570 --> 01:01.650
and then once I've done that I'll just press command X and that will remove the white from that area

01:02.610 --> 01:06.780
I'll press shift command a to de-select everything.

01:06.780 --> 01:14.040
And now if I zoom out just a bit with the minus key I can come over here to the rectangle select tool

01:14.070 --> 01:22.880
and click and drag out here press control or command X shift command a to de-select and then I'll drag

01:22.880 --> 01:27.790
select this area over here as well and remove that.

01:28.070 --> 01:34.610
Now that we have this I think I probably need to clean it up just a little bit more so maybe down here

01:35.030 --> 01:44.780
I could use that fuzzy select tool and just select the white here and remove that and also maybe I'll

01:44.780 --> 01:49.050
remove some of the white from this area as well.

01:55.250 --> 02:01.280
All right so now that we have that taken care of I think we can save this out as a P and G that we can

02:01.280 --> 02:02.950
use now as a stencil.

02:03.170 --> 02:11.450
So I'll go to file export and I'll save this out as a P N G.

02:12.720 --> 02:17.690
Back here in Blendr we need to bring that stencil into our texture here.

02:17.700 --> 02:25.170
Now if I go over to the texture panel in the Properties window I currently have the image texture selected

02:25.180 --> 02:29.920
So this is the image over here of our painted texture.

02:29.980 --> 02:34.090
I need to switch this from image to brush texture.

02:34.500 --> 02:43.640
And now instead of this burlap seamless I'll bring in that flour sack logo stencil and there it is now

02:43.640 --> 02:51.580
to be able to get this onto our image we need to switch our brush mapping from tiled to Stenzel And

02:51.580 --> 02:56.450
now if I hover over here you can see it appearing in the 3-D view right here.

02:56.590 --> 03:03.520
Now to move this around instead of using the middle mouse button the way we do to move into 3-D view

03:03.820 --> 03:10.600
we use the right mouse button to click and drag and move this around to where we want it.

03:10.600 --> 03:16.280
So I think I'll kind of tumble around like this.

03:16.570 --> 03:24.310
And now I can move this around and I can press shift and right mouse button and click and drag and increase

03:24.310 --> 03:26.360
the size of that.

03:26.520 --> 03:32.370
Now I'll just kind of move it around until I think something like this.

03:32.440 --> 03:39.310
I can also press the control button and the right mouse button and rotate it just a little bit like

03:39.310 --> 03:40.590
that.

03:40.720 --> 03:46.630
Now that it's in place I want to choose a color I'll choose a blue color here and then I'll switch my

03:46.630 --> 03:49.520
Blin mode to multiply.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.080
I'll also bring the strength down a bit to maybe.

03:52.080 --> 03:55.930
Let's type in point five and try that.

03:55.930 --> 04:02.410
Now come back over here to the 3D view and just click and drag and let's see how it works.

04:03.210 --> 04:08.730
I'll just paint over all of this area as well as the 25 pound area down here.

04:09.870 --> 04:10.950
And here we go.

04:11.310 --> 04:18.510
Now switch from stencil to tiled and now we can see the texture on our SAC.

04:18.510 --> 04:22.070
Now it's a little bit dark for me.

04:22.230 --> 04:24.770
Maybe I'll bring it down to point seven for the strength.

04:24.780 --> 04:31.020
And now let's come over here and go ahead and click and drag and see what we can paint on here.

04:31.020 --> 04:39.510
Now if I switch my brush mapping from stencil to tiled again you can see we've got our logo stenciled

04:39.510 --> 04:40.610
on the bag.

04:40.740 --> 04:47.280
And if we zoom in I can see it's actually kind of conforming to our texture as well which is really

04:47.280 --> 04:48.260
nice.

04:48.780 --> 04:56.430
So now that we have that painted on in our next video let's work on painting in some of the shading

04:56.430 --> 05:00.180
here on the bag as well as adjusting the colors.

05:00.180 --> 05:01.940
I think this is a little dark.

05:01.950 --> 05:06.690
We can work on adjusting the colors in the note editor as well.
