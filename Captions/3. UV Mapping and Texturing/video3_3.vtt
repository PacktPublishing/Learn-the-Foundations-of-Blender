00:00.910 --> 00:07.000
Let's now try putting our U-V tools to the test by trying to map this object a adore.

00:07.000 --> 00:14.230
This is from the Blendr 401 creating a game environment course here on Blendr 101 dot com.

00:14.440 --> 00:19.170
And the store as it was modeled is currently made up of four different objects.

00:19.180 --> 00:26.150
We've got the main door panel two door knobs and the door plate here at the edge.

00:26.170 --> 00:30.490
So let's work on U-V mapping this main door piece.

00:30.490 --> 00:38.830
First I'm going to go over to my U-V editing screen that lay out and notice I already have a node editor

00:38.920 --> 00:46.650
window pulled down here that's going to make my life a little easier as we apply our U-V test grid.

00:46.660 --> 00:53.830
So with the door selected I'll go ahead and press shift h to isolate it to kind of hide all the other

00:53.830 --> 00:56.910
objects and Alt-Tab into edit mode.

00:56.920 --> 00:58.760
And let's take a look at this.

00:58.900 --> 01:06.220
Now this is going to be one of those wood veneer wood panel kind of doors so I think what we can do

01:06.250 --> 01:11.660
is just break each of the faces out into their own U-V Island.

01:11.980 --> 01:21.910
So if I go to edge mode and I'll just select each of these edges all the way around like this and maybe

01:21.910 --> 01:23.210
this as well.

01:24.510 --> 01:30.340
I'll go ahead and mark these seams with control E and Mark seam.

01:30.450 --> 01:34.920
Now I grab those edges here at the corners as well.

01:34.920 --> 01:40.190
Go ahead and mark those and down here at the bottom.

01:43.140 --> 01:49.450
Control easy mark seem so I've just gone through and marked every seam on the object.

01:49.740 --> 01:56.020
I'll select everything with the Aiki press you and unwrap and here's what we get.

01:56.060 --> 02:01.410
Now here in the panel in the tools panel if we press t we can see it here.

02:01.520 --> 02:07.730
I have the option to use angle based or conformal for my U-V map.

02:07.730 --> 02:12.920
And you'll notice here that there really isn't a difference between either one of them.

02:13.040 --> 02:16.580
And that tells us that our scale is uniform.

02:16.580 --> 02:23.720
If I hit the in key and come over here to our properties panel and tab into object mode you can see

02:23.720 --> 02:26.380
that the scale here is all ones.

02:26.540 --> 02:31.230
Currently the rotation has a 90 degree turn in the x axis.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.550
But that's not really going to affect us too much.

02:34.550 --> 02:40.030
I can go ahead and press control a and apply the rotation as well.

02:40.040 --> 02:48.590
Now this is all zeros scale all ones we can try it again and see if that makes any difference at all.

02:49.490 --> 02:56.180
And it makes a slight difference in the rotation and placement of the islands but ultimately their scale

02:56.180 --> 02:57.610
hasn't changed any.

02:57.620 --> 03:04.900
So as we did before let's go ahead and create a U-V test pattern to apply to this to see how we're doing.

03:05.040 --> 03:13.880
I'll come down here and click new and I'll call this U.V. test and let's generate a U.V. grid pattern

03:14.890 --> 03:16.230
click OK.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.690
And there we go.

03:17.740 --> 03:20.980
Now I need to apply a material to this object.

03:20.980 --> 03:27.420
I click new and for this let's just call this material U-V test as well.

03:27.490 --> 03:33.660
I'll go ahead and press shift a bring in an image texture right here.

03:34.060 --> 03:41.210
And for this I'll just grab this pull down menu and select U-V test.

03:41.250 --> 03:47.940
I'll connect the nodes and come down here and choose texture viewport shading.

03:47.950 --> 03:53.590
Now we can see whether our U-V islands will stretch our texture or not.

03:53.590 --> 03:55.900
And it's looking pretty good actually.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.440
I think this is pretty usable.

03:58.600 --> 04:01.160
I'll hit the A key and take a look at it over here.

04:01.390 --> 04:05.910
Let's turn on that stretch coloration right here.

04:06.660 --> 04:08.980
So we can see the islands a little better.

04:09.150 --> 04:18.150
Now I know that I'm going to need a wood texture a wood texture grain to apply to this U-V map and to

04:18.150 --> 04:19.860
make my life easier.

04:20.100 --> 04:27.780
I should probably arrange these the islands in the same direction so that when I apply that wood texture

04:28.110 --> 04:33.660
I can apply it in one direction and it'll work for all my U-V islands.

04:33.660 --> 04:41.880
So if I come over here and choose U-V Island selection like that there and select one of these U-V islands

04:42.480 --> 04:47.870
I can now rotate it by pressing r 9 0 and hit enter.

04:47.950 --> 04:54.060
And now I can hit G and move it around in place next to the other U-V island.

04:54.150 --> 05:00.660
I can also do the same for these I can click these and shift select that and move these over here as

05:00.660 --> 05:02.100
well.

05:02.100 --> 05:06.620
And for these I can select these empresse are 9 0.

05:06.960 --> 05:11.800
Rotate those around and move these into place here.

05:11.800 --> 05:12.900
There we go.

05:13.330 --> 05:20.970
So now we have our U-V map of our door in place now to maximize our resolution in our U-V space here.

05:21.010 --> 05:28.980
It's a good idea to select everything and scale them up so they fit as tightly as possible within this

05:29.020 --> 05:30.720
zero to one space.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.870
However I've still got more to do.

05:32.880 --> 05:40.200
I've still got the door knobs and the door plate to do so I'll just undo this and wait to scale that

05:40.200 --> 05:41.110
up.

05:41.130 --> 05:49.510
Now I call this the zero to one space because just like on a graph here at this corner is zero zero

05:49.890 --> 05:51.990
and up here is 1 1.

05:52.140 --> 05:56.030
Over here is 0 1 and 1 0.

05:56.040 --> 06:02.610
If we take a look at the cursor settings here I'm just going to scroll a couple of these up so we can

06:02.610 --> 06:04.920
see the cursor settings.

06:05.040 --> 06:06.060
Here it is.

06:06.060 --> 06:10.690
You can see that the cursor here is at zero zero.

06:10.710 --> 06:17.590
I'm going to turn on normalized so that our coordinates are from 0 to 1 here.

06:17.610 --> 06:18.910
Turn that on.

06:18.960 --> 06:27.960
Now if I change this y to one you can see that the cursor snaps appear to coordinate 0 1.

06:27.960 --> 06:38.390
If I change the X to 1 the cursor snaps appear to 1 1 and if I change the Y to zero it snaps down here

06:38.720 --> 06:41.150
to 1 0.

06:41.150 --> 06:48.310
Now if I turn off normalized you can see that it gives the coordinates in the pixel resolution 10:24.

06:48.340 --> 06:56.050
If I type in 10:24 here that will put the cursor up there but generally speaking this is called the

06:56.050 --> 07:02.330
zero to one space because the coordinates go from zero to 1.

07:02.900 --> 07:09.130
So when we're U-V mapping our objects it's a good idea to keep all of the U.V. islands inside this is

07:09.140 --> 07:13.250
zero to one the space before we finalize the U.V. map.

07:13.250 --> 07:19.000
Now you can of course grab one of these and move them outside that zero to one space.

07:19.010 --> 07:24.790
And this is fine as you're creating and working with the U-V map.

07:24.920 --> 07:32.840
However not all 3D applications are going to be able to see U-V islands outside of the zero to one space.

07:32.840 --> 07:40.160
Some can some can't but to be safe it's a good idea to keep everything inside the zero to one space

07:41.180 --> 07:46.580
in the next video will continue U.V. mapping our door working on the door knobs and the door plate.
