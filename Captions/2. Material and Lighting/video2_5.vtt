WEBVTT

00:00.790 --> 00:06.520
Well we've looked at rendering and our camera we've looked at lighting and seen scale.

00:06.520 --> 00:10.530
Now we can actually begin assigning materials to our scene.

00:10.660 --> 00:17.440
So for the first object to assign a material it's maybe like this bullheadedness like this and hit the

00:17.440 --> 00:21.240
period key on the numpad and zoom into it.

00:21.550 --> 00:28.000
If we come over here to the materials panel in the Properties window right here we can see that we have

00:28.000 --> 00:30.730
no materials on this whatsoever.

00:30.730 --> 00:33.540
So to create a material we just need to click new.

00:34.090 --> 00:35.560
And there we go.

00:35.590 --> 00:42.220
Now this has an actual material that reacts to light in a specific way.

00:42.220 --> 00:48.790
So I'll go ahead and switch over to the viewport shading rendered view and we don't see much of a difference

00:48.790 --> 00:49.680
here.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.830
Let me select it here and go ahead and zoom in as well.

00:53.980 --> 00:55.700
Right over here.

00:56.430 --> 01:01.420
And let's keep a close eye on this as we adjust our materials.

01:01.420 --> 01:05.450
Now so far there isn't much of a difference here for the ball.

01:05.570 --> 01:12.670
And let's go ahead and change the name of this material to bowl just so we know what it is.

01:12.700 --> 01:15.220
The basic diffuse Shater is pretty bland.

01:15.220 --> 01:16.510
There isn't much to it.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.200
It's kind of like a piece of paper.

01:18.350 --> 01:23.070
There's no reflection or secularity no highlights to it.

01:23.140 --> 01:25.940
It's just kind of a flat matte color.

01:25.990 --> 01:29.130
We can change the color here in our color swatch.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.740
Maybe we want this to be kind of a green.

01:33.070 --> 01:34.340
And there we go.

01:34.960 --> 01:42.140
And you can see now with the cycle's lighting how even some of that green is being reflected off onto

01:42.160 --> 01:43.420
the counter.

01:43.420 --> 01:51.030
So this is what I meant by how the lights react in a real world way as they bounce around the scene.

01:51.040 --> 01:58.450
So OK so if we have our green bowl here what if we wanted to make it a little bit shiny or maybe have

01:58.660 --> 02:02.140
some highlights or even a little reflection.

02:02.380 --> 02:04.900
Let's take a look at how to do that.

02:04.930 --> 02:11.230
I'm going to open up a new window here by clicking in this tab right here and dragging down.

02:11.230 --> 02:14.540
Now we have these two 3-D view windows.

02:14.660 --> 02:20.380
I'm going to hit the T key up here to close that tool's panel and then what I'll do is help change this

02:20.380 --> 02:25.040
window type from a 3D view to a note editor.

02:25.720 --> 02:26.760
And here we go.

02:26.830 --> 02:30.640
These are the nodes that make up our materials.

02:30.760 --> 02:36.630
And once again I am in the cycle's render engine if you aren't this Windu is going to look a bit different.

02:36.760 --> 02:38.950
Now just to be sure we're all on the same page here.

02:38.950 --> 02:43.270
I have the shader no type selected.

02:43.270 --> 02:48.370
We also have a composite ing nodes and texture nodes.

02:48.370 --> 02:55.460
But here we want our material because we want to be able to see the shader or material that we're building.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.540
In addition I have used nodes selected.

02:58.720 --> 03:03.730
So be sure you have that selected to be able to see the nodes up here in the window.

03:03.730 --> 03:10.420
All right so we know we have this diffuse Shater and this is mainly just the color of the object.

03:10.540 --> 03:19.150
That's all that is if we want to add any Specularia any highlights any reflection anything else to this

03:19.150 --> 03:20.030
material.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.060
We're going to need to add a new node.

03:22.240 --> 03:28.120
So let's come down here and click on Add And now we have all these nodes that we can choose from.

03:28.120 --> 03:36.400
There's quite a few However let's come down to Shater and choose a glossy shader.

03:36.820 --> 03:44.510
I'm going to move my mouse up to here and click and now I can place that glossy shader in the node window.

03:44.530 --> 03:51.460
Now I can grab one of these sockets and click it and drag it and put it in another socket over here

03:51.550 --> 03:54.010
into the material output.

03:54.010 --> 04:00.700
And if I do that it cuts off the green and just gives me the glossy Shater and now you can see it looks

04:00.700 --> 04:03.200
kind of like a brushed metal.

04:03.610 --> 04:09.160
I can increase the roughness and it will become just a gray matte finish.

04:09.520 --> 04:16.630
Or I can take the roughness all the way down and it becomes like like a mirror and reflects the other

04:16.630 --> 04:18.450
objects in the scene.

04:18.460 --> 04:24.820
However this isn't quite what I was looking for what I want is a green ball with just a little bit of

04:24.820 --> 04:26.310
shine to it.

04:26.320 --> 04:34.340
So what we need to do is bring these two nodes into the material output to do that we need to mix them.

04:34.360 --> 04:40.070
So I'll come up here to add Shater and choose a mix shader.

04:40.540 --> 04:42.240
I'll put that here between the two.

04:42.250 --> 04:49.680
And as I hover over that connection it highlights and if I click it will automatically connect it.

04:49.690 --> 04:57.270
So now I'm going to put this connection on the bottom Shater socket and take the diffuse to the top

04:58.500 --> 04:59.510
and there we go.

04:59.730 --> 05:07.320
Now we've got a green bowl that has some reflection on it and we can adjust how much of each of these

05:07.320 --> 05:13.830
is coming through to our material output by adjusting the mix factor here if I take this all the way

05:13.830 --> 05:14.870
up to one.

05:14.940 --> 05:17.640
We see no green whatsoever.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.840
And I take it all the way down we only see the green.

05:21.000 --> 05:26.220
Now I think I'm going to take it back up to oh something like point three.

05:26.220 --> 05:34.560
And I'll also increase the roughness a bit on the glossy Shater so it isn't quite so shiny.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.420
So let's see what we think about this.

05:37.560 --> 05:44.820
Now we've got our green bowl but with a little bit of shine to it we can kind of see some highlights

05:44.820 --> 05:52.050
and a little bit of reflection happening inside the bowl and of course how you want to adjust this is

05:52.050 --> 05:53.040
totally up to you.

05:53.040 --> 05:57.680
I'm going to maybe bring this up a little bit more so we can see the reflection in the bowl.

05:58.800 --> 06:00.210
Let's try another one.

06:00.240 --> 06:08.820
I'm going to zoom out here and what I'll do is go ahead and hit the zero key in this view and I'll switch

06:08.820 --> 06:16.060
this view back to the solid view and I'll come over here and change this from the solid to rendered.

06:16.090 --> 06:18.350
And now we can work in this view.

06:18.510 --> 06:24.210
I'll zoom out and let's think about the color of the cabinets.

06:24.210 --> 06:31.220
I'm thinking that the cabinets up here should probably be like a gray like maybe a deep gray.

06:31.230 --> 06:33.390
Let's give that a try.

06:33.390 --> 06:39.080
So I'll select the cabinets up here and you can see they've been selected because it says cabinets here.

06:39.180 --> 06:45.040
Create a new material click new and call this cabinets.

06:45.360 --> 06:54.750
I'll change the color from a white to kind of a medium gray here maybe something like that.

06:55.620 --> 07:08.750
And then I'll add a glossy shader to it add Shater glossy and I'll also add a mix Shater as well.

07:08.750 --> 07:13.690
Connect those two up and see how it looks.

07:13.730 --> 07:17.250
I think I'd like it to be a little bit darker than this.

07:17.330 --> 07:23.930
I can choose the color swatch here on the diffuse Shater or I can come back over here and you can see

07:23.930 --> 07:29.060
our two nodes listed here in the surface area of the materials panel.

07:29.060 --> 07:36.200
So if I just open up this little plus right here I have access to the color here so I can click that

07:36.800 --> 07:40.950
and maybe I'll take it down just a little bit.

07:42.220 --> 07:52.400
Kind of like that and I'm not sure I need that much shine on it so maybe I'll bring the mix factor down

07:52.400 --> 07:54.640
maybe two point three.

07:54.640 --> 08:03.380
I can actually type in point three here and if I want to I can take the roughness up just a bit and

08:03.380 --> 08:04.890
see how that looks.

08:06.300 --> 08:11.040
So that's the basic process of adding and setting up our materials on our objects.

08:11.070 --> 08:19.560
Now we can add multiple materials to an object and also we have many more shader nodes to choose from

08:19.560 --> 08:20.870
here as well.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.580
So in the next video we'll take a look at using a few of those.
