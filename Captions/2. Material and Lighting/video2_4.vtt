WEBVTT

00:00.630 --> 00:03.240
Well we have our camera and lights in the scene.

00:03.240 --> 00:09.990
Now there's one more thing I want to talk about regarding lighting using the cycle's render engine the

00:09.990 --> 00:12.870
lights for cycles are Ray lights.

00:12.900 --> 00:20.490
And that means that they use real world scale real world measurements for their calculations about how

00:20.550 --> 00:22.730
the light bounces around the scene.

00:22.920 --> 00:28.260
So for your scene to look its best you really need to have the scene be real world scale.

00:28.330 --> 00:31.690
So let's take a look and see if we're there.

00:31.740 --> 00:39.990
I'm going to come over here to the scene panel and under here you can see we've got a unit's panel and

00:40.140 --> 00:46.310
under the length we can change our system of unit from none which is just a blender.

00:46.350 --> 00:53.060
Standard units or metric or the imperial system of feet and inches.

00:53.070 --> 00:59.100
Now I'm here in the United States where the Imperial system is king as it were.

00:59.280 --> 01:01.990
So I'm going to choose that for now.

01:02.010 --> 01:09.600
Now if I hit the End key I can come over here and let's select say this counter-top these cabinets and

01:09.600 --> 01:10.750
countertop.

01:10.980 --> 01:19.860
And if we take a look at its transformations we can see that it is rotated 90 degrees in the x axis.

01:19.980 --> 01:25.910
That's going to be problematic in terms of figuring out how big our scene is.

01:25.920 --> 01:33.340
So what I need to do is make sure that all of these transforms are zeroed out or we have all ones in

01:33.340 --> 01:38.820
the scale here that will help us figure out how big things should be.

01:38.820 --> 01:44.200
So to do that I'm going to press control a and apply the rotation here.

01:44.250 --> 01:49.380
If I click this you can see that my rotations now are all zeroes.

01:49.620 --> 01:57.560
If we would have had anything but the ones in the scale I could have chosen rotation and scale.

01:57.570 --> 01:59.790
All right so now let's take a look at this.

01:59.790 --> 02:08.580
I'm going to create a cube here in another layer and scale it to the size that my cabinets need to be.

02:08.580 --> 02:12.660
Now my cabinets need to be about 36 inches high.

02:12.660 --> 02:19.950
I've gone out to Google and just googled what the standard height for kitchen counters are and it's

02:19.950 --> 02:26.400
about thirty four and a half inches for this and maybe if we add the backsplash let's call it 36 inches

02:26.460 --> 02:27.840
or three feet.

02:27.840 --> 02:36.220
So I'm going to come over here to a new layer and I will create a cube here.

02:36.270 --> 02:40.730
Now notice this cube is two feet by two feet.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.290
I need it to be three feet tall.

02:43.290 --> 02:49.230
So in the Z dimension I'll just type three and hit enter.

02:49.230 --> 02:51.610
And now we've got three feet.

02:51.630 --> 02:56.150
Now if I had wanted three inches I would type in three.

02:56.160 --> 03:00.320
And then the double quotes and that would be three inches.

03:00.450 --> 03:03.420
But let's go back to three feet.

03:03.420 --> 03:11.790
Now if I hit my three key and five key on my number pad and my period keyed to zoom in.

03:11.790 --> 03:19.330
Let's now move this up so it sits on the grid and we can see how tall three feet is.

03:19.330 --> 03:21.670
So there we go all tumble around.

03:21.670 --> 03:29.230
Hit the five key and now let's bring back the other part of the scene I'll shift click here on that

03:29.590 --> 03:35.130
layer and we can see now that this scene is really way too big.

03:35.530 --> 03:41.080
So what let's do is let's move this cube over here.

03:42.200 --> 03:46.620
And let's scale our scene to fit this height.

03:46.790 --> 03:52.310
So I'll just choose this one layer and I'll hit the A key to select everything.

03:52.310 --> 04:00.350
Now if I scale down if I hit the esky you'll see that it scales from the center of all of the objects

04:00.530 --> 04:08.270
and I don't want that so I'll hit escape what I want to do is scale from the center of the grid right

04:08.270 --> 04:16.620
down here I can move the cursor to the center of the grid pressing shift s and cursor to center.

04:17.180 --> 04:21.800
And now I can change my pivot point to the 3D cursor.

04:21.800 --> 04:27.710
You can see that that transform gizmo moved down to the 3D cursor there.

04:27.710 --> 04:32.960
And now as I hit s and scale it scales in there from that point.

04:32.990 --> 04:37.680
All right so now what we can do is bring back our cube.

04:37.740 --> 04:45.290
Yet the three key the five key I'll even hit the Z key here and it looks like my cube is still selected.

04:45.290 --> 04:49.960
So I need to de-select that won't let me come over here and hit the A key.

04:49.970 --> 04:55.660
Now I'll shift select that layer and everything is still selected there.

04:55.670 --> 05:03.600
Now I just need to scale it down until the countertops are the same size as my cube.

05:03.610 --> 05:04.000
All right.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.730
Here we go.

05:04.780 --> 05:05.810
Hit the s key.

05:05.830 --> 05:10.850
Scale it down until about right there.

05:11.870 --> 05:13.000
Move this over.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.890
Let me move this over.

05:14.890 --> 05:19.670
Change the median point move it over to the side just so I can see it a little bit better.

05:22.340 --> 05:24.300
Select all of those again.

05:26.120 --> 05:29.450
Change the cursor back to 3-D.

05:29.840 --> 05:33.040
And I want to scale it down just a little bit more here.

05:33.840 --> 05:38.330
Read about there yeah that will work.

05:38.340 --> 05:46.560
So now that we've done that all of the lights in the scene are going to interact with the scene in a

05:46.560 --> 05:49.370
more realistic way.

05:49.410 --> 05:50.450
So let's try it.

05:50.640 --> 05:54.910
Let's come over here to the render panel and hit the render button.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.670
Well now there quite a difference isn't there.

05:59.710 --> 06:04.150
And the reason why everything is a bit brighter is because everything's closer.

06:04.510 --> 06:09.480
The illumination or the intensity of the lights is still the same.

06:09.550 --> 06:12.730
It's just that now everything is closer to the lights.

06:12.970 --> 06:16.180
So therefore we need to reduce the intensity of the lights.

06:16.210 --> 06:22.120
And this is what I mean by it is reacting as if everything is real world scale.

06:22.390 --> 06:28.360
So whereas the lighting setup looked fine when the scene was very big.

06:28.360 --> 06:32.260
We need to do a little adjusting now that it has real world signs.

06:32.470 --> 06:39.640
And keep in mind you can model as you go is you're creating a scene you can model each of the objects

06:39.820 --> 06:47.180
in real world scale making sure each object in each thing is exactly the size it should be.

06:47.500 --> 06:54.100
Or like we did here you can model your scene at any size you want.

06:54.100 --> 06:59.280
Making sure however that everything is in proportion to everything else in the scene.

06:59.620 --> 07:04.230
But then at the very end you can just select it all and scale it down.

07:04.630 --> 07:13.450
So what I do is I usually model pretty big keeping everything in proportion and then simply selecting

07:13.450 --> 07:16.740
it all scaling it down to the correct size.

07:16.900 --> 07:24.310
Then I add the lines but I wanted to do it like this just to show you the difference that scale can

07:24.310 --> 07:25.180
make.

07:25.180 --> 07:30.920
So let's go back in and adjust the intensity of the lights here.

07:31.000 --> 07:35.910
I'll just turn on the rendered viewport shading mode here.

07:36.010 --> 07:41.720
Select one of my area lights and let's reduce the intensity here.

07:41.770 --> 07:42.710
I'll take the strength.

07:42.790 --> 07:45.050
Let's just take it down to one for now.

07:45.310 --> 07:46.830
I'll do the same over here.

07:49.240 --> 07:56.420
And for the sunlight maybe this will work out just fine let's go in and keep it at one and see how that

07:56.510 --> 07:58.060
works.

07:58.070 --> 08:03.520
In addition while I'm here I'm going to change the name of the light sensor to sunlight.

08:03.530 --> 08:09.200
I will change it to Sun and down here I'll change these lights.

08:09.200 --> 08:13.420
The name of these lights to maybe cabinet one.

08:14.080 --> 08:21.180
And let's change this one to say cabinet to.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.740
All right.

08:22.740 --> 08:26.720
Now let's re render our scene and see how it looks.

08:26.730 --> 08:32.480
Come back over here and render and then we have our render.

08:32.740 --> 08:33.700
Not too bad.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.050
OK.

08:35.050 --> 08:41.280
So now that we've talked about seeing scale we can move on to the next step and begin adding our materials.
