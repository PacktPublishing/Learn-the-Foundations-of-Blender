00:00.850 --> 00:07.840
Let's now add some material to the bottom of the cabinets here I'll select that and what I can do is

00:07.840 --> 00:13.430
just instead of creating a new material I can pull this menu down.

00:13.630 --> 00:16.890
And it gives me a list of the materials I've already created.

00:16.960 --> 00:24.610
So if I select the cabinets here you can see that that whole thing is given the cabinets material.

00:24.610 --> 00:27.480
However I don't want the whole thing to have the cabinet.

00:27.470 --> 00:36.580
So what we can do is come in here and tab into edit mode and I'm going to change to face mode by pressing

00:36.580 --> 00:39.190
control tab and hitting the three key.

00:39.250 --> 00:46.360
And now I just hover over one of these faces and hit the L key and that selects that whole piece.

00:46.360 --> 00:53.980
So even though these pieces are all one object the lower cabinets here have been split into different

00:53.980 --> 00:55.000
pieces.

00:55.210 --> 01:01.820
And by hovering over one of the components and pressing the L key I can select just that piece.

01:01.840 --> 01:07.150
So now will do is let's create a new material for the countertops.

01:07.210 --> 01:12.130
I think I'd like this to be kind of a white marble type of material.

01:12.340 --> 01:19.780
So with this selected one I'm going to do is create a new material slot and we can have multiple material

01:19.780 --> 01:21.760
slots for each object.

01:21.790 --> 01:27.630
So this object contains the material for the cabinets down here.

01:27.910 --> 01:35.920
But let's also create a material slot and click new here for the countertop as well.

01:35.920 --> 01:44.410
And we are now we can click a sign and that assigns that new material to the countertop.

01:44.410 --> 01:50.470
Now once again I think I'd like it to be a little bit shiny or so I'll come over here to the node editor

01:50.500 --> 02:01.610
and let's add a glossy and also a mix Shater.

02:01.870 --> 02:04.400
I'll add those in.

02:04.580 --> 02:05.160
And here we go.

02:05.160 --> 02:11.460
So now you can see we've got some refl. happening for that kitchen counter.

02:11.480 --> 02:15.620
Now that's not bad but I think I want to increase the roughness here.

02:15.740 --> 02:16.930
Take that up a bit.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.870
There we go.

02:21.410 --> 02:27.370
Now for these handles here I think what I want is some sort of more metallic material.

02:27.410 --> 02:35.750
So let me just pan up a bit tumble around here and move in a little bit closer to our handles.

02:36.380 --> 02:44.630
And now I can come through and hovering over each of these press the L key and I'll just select each

02:44.720 --> 02:47.400
of these little handles.

02:47.630 --> 02:54.080
Now that those have been selected let's create a new material slot will create a new material in that

02:54.080 --> 02:59.290
slot and we'll call these drawer handles.

03:00.620 --> 03:05.450
Now we need to set up our node tree for this particular material.

03:05.450 --> 03:14.270
I can add a new note up here by pressing shift a and choosing shader glossy.

03:14.580 --> 03:22.160
And also all press shift a and choose a mix Shater as well and we go.

03:22.340 --> 03:28.920
Now I need to apply this or a sign that material to the handle's click a sign.

03:29.030 --> 03:30.880
And there they are.

03:31.070 --> 03:39.680
Now I think for these I'd like the roughness to come down in the glossy and maybe move that factory

03:39.680 --> 03:45.920
up 2.6 or something like that so we get a little bit more of a glint off of those handles.

03:45.980 --> 03:53.690
So not only can you add material to an object but you can add multiple material slots to an object and

03:53.690 --> 04:00.060
then assign the materials in each slot to collections of faces on the object.

04:00.530 --> 04:04.530
So let's take a look at this utensil container.

04:04.820 --> 04:11.870
I'll zoom in and I'll also zoom in over here also selected here and zoom in here as well.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.060
So let's add a base material first for the container.

04:18.110 --> 04:19.310
I'll add a material.

04:19.310 --> 04:22.330
Call it utensil container.

04:22.850 --> 04:32.820
And for this I want it to be fairly white and fairly shiny so I'll add a glossy and a mix.

04:32.960 --> 04:33.680
Drop it in

04:36.350 --> 04:38.630
and I don't think I want it to be that white.

04:38.630 --> 04:47.350
Maybe I'll bring it down just a little bit in the gray and take that mix shade or down a little bit

04:48.350 --> 04:51.900
and I'll bring the roughness of the glossy up as well.

04:52.010 --> 04:57.260
And that kind of spreads out the specular a highlight on the container.

04:57.260 --> 05:05.060
Now I'll go in and select each of these individual pieces within the utensils container and assign a

05:05.060 --> 05:07.040
new material slot to them.

05:07.040 --> 05:16.610
So for this spoon here let me tumble around just a bit so we can see it for this spoon Alt-Tab into

05:16.700 --> 05:18.070
edit mode.

05:18.080 --> 05:24.540
I'll hit the L key to choose this whole piece and I'll add a new material slot.

05:24.680 --> 05:28.900
I'll call this let's call it metal spoon

05:31.300 --> 05:42.480
assign the material bring in a new glossy as well as a mix

05:45.720 --> 05:47.440
and connect these up.

05:47.580 --> 05:54.860
I'll take the roughness down quite a bit and maybe take the mix factor up as well.

05:55.050 --> 05:58.680
So we get some reflection in that material.

05:58.680 --> 06:07.830
The next one I'll do is this spatula I'll select that piece of the object with the L key give it a new

06:07.830 --> 06:18.780
material slot and in New material we'll call it spatula will assign it and we'll give it just a little

06:18.780 --> 06:25.740
bit of a gloss with a glossy and a mix

06:30.060 --> 06:34.070
and something like this.

06:34.070 --> 06:38.690
Now if you'd like to see what material you have on what piece of the object you can always come over

06:38.690 --> 06:47.600
here and select or de-select the objects I can de-select that spatula choose the metal spoon and select

06:47.600 --> 06:51.940
it and you can see I only have that material on this object.

06:52.010 --> 07:00.710
I think I'll try and put a wood colored handle on our spatula handle here or create a new material slot

07:02.330 --> 07:12.520
new and I'll call this I'll just call this would sign it and let's go ahead and add our nodes Once again

07:13.090 --> 07:17.460
I'll just bring in a glossy and mix

07:20.250 --> 07:32.300
and here we go now take the color to kind of a brown ish and I'll take that glossy this way down I can

07:32.300 --> 07:39.710
also increase the roughness in the diffuse Shater here and that'll give it a little bit more of a texture

07:39.710 --> 07:42.020
to it or at least the illusion of it.

07:42.020 --> 07:48.930
Now what we can do is go ahead and add that same material to these other pieces here.

07:49.030 --> 07:55.980
I'll go ahead and select this this and this with the L key.

07:56.150 --> 08:01.430
And now let's click a sign with the word material selected.

08:01.720 --> 08:02.850
And there we go.

08:03.250 --> 08:09.880
So in this way we can go through and select each of our objects and the pieces within each of our objects

08:10.030 --> 08:12.100
to assign the materials we want.
