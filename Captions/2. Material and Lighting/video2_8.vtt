WEBVTT

00:00.920 --> 00:05.480
Well let's use our noise texture trick again on this orange here.

00:05.750 --> 00:15.140
I'll zoom in here and let's go ahead and turn on the rendered viewport shading right here so we can

00:15.140 --> 00:18.650
see it as we adjust our material.

00:18.740 --> 00:25.960
Now it is so good so I'll go ahead and add a new material over here and I'll just call it orange.

00:26.040 --> 00:38.250
In addition I will add a glossy shader here shift a shade or glossy and a mix Shater as well.

00:38.250 --> 00:43.680
Put that in here and combine those two into our material output.

00:43.680 --> 00:47.860
So now we can see our oranges a little shiny.

00:47.940 --> 00:52.350
We need to change it to an orange or the color orange here.

00:52.680 --> 00:58.050
Let's maybe give it a nice orange color maybe a little bit brighter than that.

00:58.950 --> 01:00.320
Something like that.

01:00.780 --> 01:05.330
And also we have this stem here we need to split that out as well.

01:05.370 --> 01:13.830
So I'll go back to my salad viewport shading go into edit mode and I'll hover over this piece right

01:13.860 --> 01:23.280
here and select the L key and let's create a new material slot for it and we'll call this orange stem

01:25.290 --> 01:27.540
and we'll give that a green for now.

01:27.540 --> 01:32.070
We don't need to have it be anything special quite yet.

01:33.170 --> 01:37.230
Something like that and I click sign.

01:37.250 --> 01:42.080
All right so now let's go back to our rendered viewport shading.

01:42.430 --> 01:46.030
And so there we have our STEM it's a little bit too bright.

01:46.040 --> 01:51.940
Maybe I'll bring it down to the brown end of the spectrum a little bit.

01:52.630 --> 01:56.460
Something like that for now we'll work on that here in a bit.

01:56.470 --> 02:04.900
Let's go back to our Ornge and what I want to do here is try and add some texture to the orange.

02:04.900 --> 02:10.460
The way we did for the paper towel now it is of course a little bit too shiny here.

02:10.520 --> 02:13.440
I'll take this down to a point to perhaps.

02:13.480 --> 02:22.320
And now let's go ahead and add a noise texture with shift a texture noise.

02:22.560 --> 02:32.830
And also let's add a converter to convert from R.G. to black and white.

02:33.360 --> 02:44.970
Connect up those color sockets let's also add once again a math note and switch it to multiply and then

02:44.970 --> 02:50.880
we'll connect those up and this into the displacement socket.

02:51.060 --> 02:52.290
And here we go.

02:52.530 --> 03:00.790
That's not quite what I was going for but that's OK we'll take the scale up to say 50.

03:00.810 --> 03:02.840
See how that works.

03:03.030 --> 03:06.580
And that's getting there but still not quite what I was wanting.

03:06.780 --> 03:11.980
Let's take the multiply value down to like point 0 1.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.980
See if that helps any.

03:14.490 --> 03:18.770
So now we're getting something that's a little bit more like an orange skin.

03:18.840 --> 03:23.380
We have that slight bump on our material.

03:23.380 --> 03:28.380
However one thing that I'm seeing here is that the orange color is too uniform.

03:28.500 --> 03:36.090
It's too perfect we need a little bit of differentiation in the color of the surface of the orange.

03:36.330 --> 03:40.160
So to do that let me bring this window down a bit.

03:40.160 --> 03:44.770
So we have a little bit more room in our node Ed. up here.

03:45.000 --> 03:52.620
And what I'm looking for is some sort of difference in color here coming in to the diffuse Shater.

03:52.620 --> 04:01.050
So once again I think we can use a noise texture bring one of those in a noise texture here and if we

04:01.050 --> 04:04.230
feed it into the color we see we get that.

04:04.590 --> 04:06.710
And that's not quite what we want.

04:07.020 --> 04:14.910
What I'd like to do is be able to adjust the color here before it goes into the diffuse shader.

04:14.910 --> 04:24.660
So let me connect to that and to do that let's bring in a color ramp so shift a and let's go to the

04:24.690 --> 04:28.410
converter and color ramp.

04:28.410 --> 04:35.940
And here we have a node that will allow us to mix multiple colors in here on this color ramp.

04:36.240 --> 04:45.590
So I'll go ahead and connect the gray factor socket to here and the color to here.

04:45.670 --> 04:53.560
Now you can see we've got the differentiation in color coming from the noise texture but we have it

04:53.590 --> 05:00.810
just as black and white from the color ramp so we can change our colors here.

05:00.880 --> 05:03.530
I'll select this color stop.

05:03.730 --> 05:08.410
And now let's change that color to an orange again.

05:09.280 --> 05:11.050
Something like this.

05:11.590 --> 05:15.760
And now we have that orange mixing with the black.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.590
Defined by our noise texture.

05:18.760 --> 05:29.260
So maybe I'll select this color stop here and then change its color to maybe a green of some sort.

05:29.260 --> 05:37.000
Let's try a greenish color like this maybe a little bit darker like that.

05:37.060 --> 05:45.490
Now you can see we've got the orange and the green mixing together which is OK but I think I want a

05:45.490 --> 05:47.150
little bit more orange.

05:47.260 --> 05:49.670
So there are a couple of ways to do this.

05:49.670 --> 05:58.520
Now we can move from one color stop to the other with this arrow here or we can choose the map here.

05:58.570 --> 06:05.570
So if I move to the orange color I can take this and I can drag it toward the green.

06:05.590 --> 06:07.680
We can see what happens there.

06:08.110 --> 06:13.350
And in doing that the orange almost pushes out completely the green.

06:13.390 --> 06:19.240
If I move it back toward this way the green begins to come back.

06:19.280 --> 06:29.900
So maybe what I can do is keep this color stop here add a new one by clicking on the plus and then moving

06:30.200 --> 06:34.220
this one a little closer to the green.

06:34.220 --> 06:40.220
Now I kind of like this it's just gives a hint of that green but the orange shine through for the most

06:40.220 --> 06:40.800
part.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.170
That's not bad.

06:43.220 --> 06:45.740
I think it's still a little too shiny.

06:45.770 --> 06:51.680
We could maybe try and bring the roughness up in the glossy maybe to point three.

06:51.680 --> 07:00.230
So in this way we can use something like a noise texture for both the bump or displacement of our object

07:00.770 --> 07:04.730
and we can also use it to add extra color to the object.

07:04.730 --> 07:10.170
Now I could add more color stops here maybe a brown one.

07:10.490 --> 07:19.100
We could even maybe take this particular one and make it more of a brown something like something like

07:19.250 --> 07:20.940
this perhaps.

07:21.260 --> 07:25.520
Now you get more of that brown in there among the orange and the green.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.580
We could move this closer to the green and see what happens there.

07:29.720 --> 07:33.140
We can move it back toward the orange.

07:33.140 --> 07:40.190
So there's a lot of different possibilities here what I'll do now is go ahead and add this particular

07:40.190 --> 07:43.090
orange material to the other oranges in the bowl.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.950
So it looks like this one is an orange.

07:45.950 --> 07:50.750
Let me just switch over to our salad view.

07:50.750 --> 07:56.000
It looks like this one is an orange and this one is an orange here.

07:56.160 --> 08:05.100
So what we can do is if we select this orange shift select this one and then shift select the one with

08:05.100 --> 08:06.900
the material on it.

08:07.080 --> 08:15.100
We can then press control L and link our materials to the ones that do not have the material.

08:15.150 --> 08:18.570
And now these have the same material.

08:18.570 --> 08:23.940
If we switch back to the rendered viewport we can see that we've added that orange material.

08:23.940 --> 08:30.900
Now we still need to go into each one and add the green for the stems and we may want to add a color

08:30.900 --> 08:35.160
ramp and some noise to the stems as well.

08:35.430 --> 08:42.110
But in that way once we create a material we can add them to other objects very quickly.

08:42.150 --> 08:47.890
Well I'll go ahead and add some materials to the other objects in the scene and in the next video.

08:48.030 --> 08:55.920
Let's take a look at some different ways of lighting are seen using both HDR images and using other

08:55.920 --> 08:58.400
objects as a light source as well.
