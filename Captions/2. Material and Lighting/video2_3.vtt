00:00.630 --> 00:07.260
Well let's take a few minutes and see if we can set up some sort of a lighting scheme for our set here

00:08.390 --> 00:10.590
for this light up here.

00:10.590 --> 00:18.810
I think maybe let's change this to sunlight and let's think about this in terms of maybe there's a window

00:18.810 --> 00:24.900
to the right of this scene maybe there's a window in the room.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.640
Sunlight is coming in.

00:26.700 --> 00:33.060
But in addition we have maybe a couple of lights on under the countertops here or under the cabinets

00:33.060 --> 00:33.720
here.

00:33.720 --> 00:34.710
So let's think about that.

00:34.710 --> 00:39.490
I always like to kind of think about what's happening in the scene.

00:39.510 --> 00:41.550
Where are the light sources.

00:41.550 --> 00:47.050
Is there a window in this scene and what time of day is it because that matters too.

00:47.070 --> 00:53.790
If it's early morning or late in the evening and we have sun coming in the window it's going to be one

00:53.790 --> 00:58.640
at a lower angle and two it's also going to be a different color.

00:58.650 --> 01:04.440
Maybe it'll be more of an orange since the sunlight is coming through the atmosphere and we have a kind

01:04.440 --> 01:07.810
of an orange sunrise or sunset.

01:07.830 --> 01:14.280
So thinking about time of day and where the light sources are really helps you as you begin to think

01:14.280 --> 01:16.420
about lighting scheme.

01:16.590 --> 01:27.780
So maybe it's like about like this let's say the sun is coming in to the windows about like this and

01:27.780 --> 01:33.510
I'll go ahead and turn on the rendered viewport and shading over here so we can kind of see what's going

01:33.510 --> 01:34.390
on.

01:34.480 --> 01:41.940
And of course since we have the sunlight it looks like there's a nuclear holocaust going on outside.

01:41.940 --> 01:43.920
So we need to change that.

01:43.950 --> 01:48.640
Let's take it down to one for now and see how that works for us.

01:48.760 --> 01:57.060
Now even with the sunlight I can change the size of the light and if I take this down quite a bit I

01:57.060 --> 02:03.740
can sharpen up those shadows and bring it down to like point five.

02:03.800 --> 02:09.530
And now the shadows should be a little sharper now as if it's coming from sunlight.

02:10.220 --> 02:13.890
Well maybe take it down a little bit more maybe to point one.

02:13.900 --> 02:14.810
Let's try that.

02:15.780 --> 02:16.920
There we go.

02:17.550 --> 02:21.950
Now that we have that in place let's also think about the color of the light.

02:22.050 --> 02:26.040
We have a color value here it's currently at white.

02:26.040 --> 02:29.610
Maybe it's a little bit.

02:29.710 --> 02:32.440
Let's take it to the blue in just a hair.

02:32.530 --> 02:40.390
Now you don't really need a lot of color when it comes to a light if you swing it way over here if it

02:40.390 --> 02:48.310
can really be disconcerting so let's just barely give it any blue at all almost so we can't tell it's

02:48.790 --> 02:50.200
there we go.

02:50.200 --> 02:57.080
So maybe we've got blue light coming from the sky since the sun is kind of high in the sky there.

02:57.160 --> 03:01.560
And now let's think about some of these lights underneath the cabinets.

03:01.570 --> 03:06.770
Maybe these are more incandescent and therefore a little bit more orange.

03:06.790 --> 03:11.440
So for these Let's create an area light I'll come back over here.

03:11.440 --> 03:17.030
Create an area and that's going to pop into the center of the grid there.

03:17.200 --> 03:26.260
I'll raise it up a bit and I'll also increase its size so we can kind of see it a little better there.

03:26.410 --> 03:34.810
Now perhaps I could go to my scale tool and scale this in just a little bit so it's kind of the shape

03:34.810 --> 03:38.560
of what an under the counter light would be.

03:38.560 --> 03:46.640
I'll switch to my move tool and just bring this up underneath right in here right under the counter.

03:51.830 --> 03:52.790
There you go.

03:54.250 --> 03:59.610
So now you can see we've got this light coming in from the top of the frame.

03:59.620 --> 04:04.090
It's once again pretty bright so I'm going to take this down to maybe 10.

04:04.090 --> 04:06.160
Let's see how that works.

04:06.160 --> 04:13.150
All right so we can see that there are go ahead and duplicate this with shift D and I'll move this out

04:13.150 --> 04:24.370
here and rotate it around the z axis so I'll press R Z 9 0 and rotate that and move it over here underneath

04:24.370 --> 04:25.840
the counter as well.

04:27.930 --> 04:30.130
Something like that.

04:30.200 --> 04:35.980
And now you can see we've got these lights coming down from where those would be.

04:35.990 --> 04:41.630
Maybe I'll move them out just a bit so we kind of center them underneath the counter just a little bit

04:41.630 --> 04:46.670
more something like that yes you can kind of see that coming down.

04:46.700 --> 04:55.100
And for the color of these Let's let's say we want it to be a little bit orange ish maybe something

04:55.100 --> 05:00.580
like this just a little bit orange ish.

05:00.880 --> 05:07.360
And this one as well I'll just move that to the Orange side of the spectrum.

05:07.610 --> 05:09.060
And there we go.

05:09.080 --> 05:16.730
So now we've got a light coming in from the right side of our screen so maybe that's an open window

05:17.150 --> 05:22.490
and then we've got a couple of lights shining down from under the cabinets.

05:22.500 --> 05:26.580
Let's go ahead and render this out and see how it looks.

05:26.580 --> 05:29.670
I'll turn the render viewport shading off.

05:29.670 --> 05:31.610
Change it to solid.

05:31.630 --> 05:35.780
Now come over here to the render panel and then click on the render button

05:38.540 --> 05:41.440
and there we are.

05:41.480 --> 05:47.130
Now we talked a little bit before about resolution and the quality of the image.

05:47.150 --> 05:49.650
We're getting a lot of grain here.

05:49.820 --> 05:51.160
So let's try two things.

05:51.170 --> 05:58.250
Let's one take the resolution up from 50 to 100 and hit render.

05:58.400 --> 06:02.020
So that looks a little bit better but we've still got quite a bit of grain.

06:02.350 --> 06:09.260
Well we can take care of that by scrolling down here and looking in the sampling area.

06:09.260 --> 06:15.230
And if we scroll that open we can see that our samples here are 10 and 10.

06:15.230 --> 06:21.010
So we're getting a preview of 10 samples and a render of 10 samples.

06:21.020 --> 06:27.870
Now yours may be a bit different here depending on if you've done any work here previously.

06:27.950 --> 06:37.880
So the preview is for our rendered viewport shading mode and the Render is for our final render here.

06:37.880 --> 06:44.190
So I'm going to bring that render up from 10 to say one hundred and let's see how this helps.

06:44.300 --> 06:49.600
I'll scroll back up and render and let's see how it looks.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.940
And there we go.

06:52.300 --> 06:55.920
Well that looks considerably better now doesn't it.

06:55.930 --> 07:03.430
But there's one thing we need to make sure and keep in mind now I have collapsed time here a bit because

07:03.940 --> 07:11.290
this rendered took almost three minutes whereas the last one took only 20 seconds.

07:11.290 --> 07:20.290
So increasing the quality or the sampling of your render drastically changes how long it takes to render

07:20.320 --> 07:21.520
each frame.

07:21.520 --> 07:25.030
So that's something to keep in mind as we move forward.

07:25.090 --> 07:32.560
Now if you're just creating a still image probably not a problem but if you're creating an animation

07:32.560 --> 07:41.320
where you have hundreds if not thousands of individual frames to render thinking about render time may

07:41.320 --> 07:44.090
be an important issue for your project.

07:44.110 --> 07:51.610
So now that we have our basic lighting setup here for our scene in the next video let's talk about scene

07:51.610 --> 07:58.040
scale how the size and scale of our objects affects the lighting in our scene.
