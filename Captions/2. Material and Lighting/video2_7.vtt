WEBVTT

00:01.020 --> 00:07.260
Using the same techniques as we used in the last video I went through and assign materials to the knife

00:07.260 --> 00:08.370
block here.

00:08.460 --> 00:14.660
So we have the basic material of the main block and you can see the node tree for that.

00:14.660 --> 00:17.380
Here we've got the knife handles.

00:17.400 --> 00:24.050
And here's it's no tree and material for the metal on each of the handles.

00:24.090 --> 00:32.280
If we zoom in here you can kind of see that each one has pieces of metal on them and one material for

00:32.310 --> 00:33.760
the knife block feet.

00:33.810 --> 00:35.410
Right here.

00:35.550 --> 00:40.640
Now let's take a look at creating the materials for this paper towel holder.

00:40.800 --> 00:44.610
And in doing so I want to add one more piece to the puzzle.

00:44.610 --> 00:51.920
I want to see if we can add a little bit of texture to the paper towels themselves.

00:52.140 --> 00:57.540
So let's select that paper towel holder object and I'll come over here and hit the period key and zoom

00:57.540 --> 00:58.980
in.

00:59.040 --> 01:01.710
And now let's think about what we want for this.

01:01.710 --> 01:09.000
I think what I want is this top part here and this bottom part to be a metallic surface.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.830
And also I want this piece and this piece on the base to be kind of a black plastic.

01:14.970 --> 01:18.350
So let's begin with the metal first.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.960
With that object selected all click new.

01:20.970 --> 01:31.340
In the materials window and let's call this paper towels metal up here in the note editor I'll go ahead

01:31.370 --> 01:43.060
and add a new node with Shift A and I'll go to Shater glossy and I'll also add a mix note as well.

01:43.060 --> 01:49.090
You know we go and I'll bring the glossy into the bottom socket of the mix Shater And here we are we're

01:49.090 --> 01:53.110
beginning to get a relatively metallic surface here.

01:53.260 --> 02:00.550
I think what I'll do for this is I think I will actually switch this around I'll change this to a solid

02:00.550 --> 02:06.150
view and I'll change this view down here to a rendered viewport shading.

02:06.190 --> 02:08.640
Now we can see it a little better.

02:08.680 --> 02:13.240
Well that's getting to be what I want but I think it's a little bit too bright.

02:13.240 --> 02:20.850
I'm going to bring the color down in the diffuse bring that down a bit like so and let's go with that

02:20.850 --> 02:25.770
for now and see how it looks once we get the other materials on there as well.

02:25.770 --> 02:32.820
All right now I need to select these other parts of the object in edit mode so I'll go back to solid

02:32.820 --> 02:36.040
here and go back to rendered up here.

02:36.210 --> 02:42.770
And now I can tab into edit mode and zoom in to this and select these other pieces.

02:42.780 --> 02:49.350
So for this I think in face mode I'll press alt and click and edge between two of the faces and press

02:49.350 --> 02:54.470
control up arrow to select this piece right here.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.780
I'll then add a material slot.

02:57.210 --> 02:59.170
Create a new material.

02:59.280 --> 03:03.400
Call this paper towels.

03:03.540 --> 03:09.580
I'll call this black plastic so I know what it is.

03:09.580 --> 03:20.900
A sign that zoom in up here so I can see that material as I work and now in vnode editor lets add a

03:21.200 --> 03:25.660
glossy shader a mix shader

03:28.660 --> 03:39.310
combine those two and I'll take the diffuse color down to a more gray or black color I think that's

03:39.310 --> 03:42.130
a little bit too shiny for plastic.

03:42.130 --> 03:49.950
I'll take the mix shader down to maybe point two and it's still looking a little metallic.

03:49.960 --> 03:55.570
And one of the reasons for that is because the specular highlights are white.

03:55.570 --> 04:02.490
We can change the color of the highlights if we click here and bring this down a little bit more into

04:02.500 --> 04:04.410
a gray.

04:04.440 --> 04:09.330
Now that material is beginning to look a little bit more plastic.

04:09.330 --> 04:12.200
So for materials to look plastic.

04:12.240 --> 04:21.140
Sometimes what you need is for the specular highlight the gloss to be more the same color as the diffuse.

04:21.240 --> 04:24.810
So I'll take the roughness down here to maybe point one.

04:25.080 --> 04:31.330
And we go and I think I'll even bring that glossy color down a little bit more.

04:31.330 --> 04:31.810
All right.

04:31.960 --> 04:33.530
Let's go with that.

04:33.900 --> 04:42.610
What I'll also do is grab this piece down here all hover over it and press the L key since it's a separate

04:42.610 --> 04:43.080
piece.

04:43.090 --> 04:45.020
I can select that whole piece.

04:45.370 --> 04:50.760
And now let's go ahead and assign this material to it.

04:50.860 --> 04:55.520
So I'll just click a sign and there we go.

04:55.530 --> 04:56.280
All right.

04:56.280 --> 05:01.480
So we have our materials set up for the plastic and the metal.

05:01.770 --> 05:03.320
What about the paper towels here.

05:03.330 --> 05:07.030
Well this is a little bit different kind of material.

05:07.020 --> 05:13.440
Let's go ahead and select it with the L key and for this once again I'll create a new material slot

05:14.300 --> 05:22.040
and new material I'll call this paper towels and we'll click a sign.

05:22.260 --> 05:25.580
So now that looks a little bit more like paper towels.

05:25.590 --> 05:35.100
But what I would like to try here is to see if I can get some sort of small texture to this so it so

05:35.100 --> 05:42.570
it has the sense that it's kind of a rough surface to it like some paper towels are we could leave it

05:42.660 --> 05:44.930
like this and that would be fine.

05:44.940 --> 05:48.590
But I think I'd like to try and get a little bit more texture to it.

05:48.600 --> 05:59.430
So what let's do is bring in a texture node and let's bring in a noise texture now a noise texture is

05:59.550 --> 06:02.630
just a bunch of colored noise.

06:02.640 --> 06:09.740
We can feed this into the color channel here of the diffuse and take a look at what it looks like.

06:09.970 --> 06:10.450
There it is.

06:10.450 --> 06:16.700
It's just kind of a mess of random colors and patterns and we can change the scale here.

06:16.710 --> 06:26.370
Maybe let's increase the scale up to say 50 and you can see how it really reduces the size of that pattern.

06:26.390 --> 06:34.450
Let's take it on up to maybe 100 and maybe this is the size of our pattern that we want for our texture

06:34.870 --> 06:39.450
but obviously we don't want to feed it in through the color channel.

06:39.520 --> 06:44.250
What we want to do is feed this in through the displacement.

06:44.380 --> 06:49.780
However we have a different color socket here for the displacement.

06:49.780 --> 06:56.950
You can see that we have different colored sockets and usually the same color socket is what you want

06:56.950 --> 06:57.700
to connect.

06:57.730 --> 07:03.510
So a green to a green a yellow to a yellow blue to a blue.

07:03.610 --> 07:08.670
So I'll just grab this and disconnected from that diffuse Shater.

07:08.950 --> 07:15.040
And now we need to think about converting this color to a black and white image.

07:15.140 --> 07:22.390
All press shift a and let's bring up the converter menu and let's choose our G.B. to black and white

07:23.460 --> 07:32.050
and we go and notice it has a color to color socket there so we can feed that color into there.

07:32.100 --> 07:38.390
Now we can see here that we have a gray value socket and we can feed that into the displacement.

07:38.430 --> 07:46.830
And when we do we can see the texture on here but that too much and I don't have any way to increase

07:46.890 --> 07:51.780
or decrease the size or effect of that texture.

07:51.780 --> 07:58.880
What we need to do is add a node in here that allows us to adjust the strength of the texture.

07:58.920 --> 08:06.270
So what we can do is press shift a and bring in under the converter menu a math node.

08:06.450 --> 08:14.610
If I click that I can add that to the chain and I can change this from ADD to multiply.

08:14.610 --> 08:20.990
Now notice we've got a gray value socket going to our gray socket here.

08:21.270 --> 08:27.410
And I can take this value in the multiply no down to say point 0 1.

08:27.510 --> 08:29.150
Something pretty small.

08:29.490 --> 08:34.340
And now you can just barely see a little bit of texture to this.

08:34.410 --> 08:37.400
We can of course increase this however much we want.

08:37.530 --> 08:43.800
But I just wanted something very subtle just to give a sense that the paper towels have just a bit of

08:43.800 --> 08:45.000
texture.

08:45.000 --> 08:45.390
All right.

08:45.390 --> 08:52.890
Let me hit zero over here to go back to our camera view and in the next video what let's do is let's

08:52.890 --> 09:00.930
take a look at using this same kind of process to maybe texture one of our pieces of fruit say an orange

09:00.930 --> 09:02.350
here in the bowl.
