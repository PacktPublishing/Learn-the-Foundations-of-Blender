00:00.970 --> 00:07.330
Another useful Shater in our materials enlighting tool toolbox is the emission Shater.

00:07.570 --> 00:13.260
This allows you to create an object and have that object emit light in the scene.

00:13.270 --> 00:17.210
But this only works in the cycles render engine.

00:17.200 --> 00:22.400
So let's say I wanted to light this scene with an object.

00:22.780 --> 00:27.170
So I'm going to go ahead and delete this sunlight here.

00:27.190 --> 00:30.390
I'll just hit X and delete.

00:30.400 --> 00:37.170
I'll also change from local to global in my transform orientation there.

00:37.360 --> 00:44.890
I'll bring the cursor back to the center with shift s and cursor to center so that when I create a polygon

00:44.890 --> 00:52.930
play it'll pop there into the center so now I'll press shift A and create that polygon plane I'll scale

00:52.930 --> 01:03.350
it up a bit and I'll move it up and over to here in the scene and what I'm going to do is use this polygon

01:03.350 --> 01:04.200
object.

01:04.940 --> 01:11.020
As a light source I'll hit R and y to rotate around the y axis.

01:11.250 --> 01:20.030
Maybe I'll move it up and even rotate it a bit so it points down into the scene like that.

01:20.050 --> 01:21.370
So let's give this a try.

01:21.370 --> 01:28.840
Now that I've created it let's go over to the material panel click new to create a new material and

01:28.840 --> 01:31.430
let's call this light.

01:31.750 --> 01:39.550
And now I'll just change the diffuse Shater from diffuse to emission.

01:39.560 --> 01:43.260
Now we don't see a whole lot of change here yet.

01:43.310 --> 01:47.640
Let's take the strength up to maybe 100 and see what happens.

01:47.660 --> 01:52.160
Now you can see that we're getting quite a bit of light from that object.

01:52.220 --> 01:53.980
That of course is a bit too much.

01:53.990 --> 01:59.600
But let's let's take it down to 20 let's say and see how that looks.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.730
Still maybe a little bit too bright let's take it down to 10.

02:04.100 --> 02:08.450
Let's try that yeah let's see how that works.

02:08.490 --> 02:18.300
If I switch to the rendered viewport shading over here you can see now that that polygon plane is emitting

02:18.390 --> 02:21.240
light into the same.

02:21.470 --> 02:30.590
All right let me switch back to my solid view and as we reduce the size of the light we can take a look

02:30.590 --> 02:38.060
at how that effects are seen and the actual size of the object affects directly the strength of the

02:38.060 --> 02:39.080
light.

02:39.110 --> 02:47.830
So I'll scale that back up maybe to about their so now maybe we've come to the point where we say OK

02:47.830 --> 02:50.610
this is the way I want my scene to look.

02:50.620 --> 02:58.800
Now I've got the materials the lighting set up the way I want I'm ready to do my final render test.

02:58.810 --> 03:06.590
So what we can do is go ahead and come back to the render panel and click on render.

03:06.610 --> 03:15.640
Now I'm rendering the image out at full resolution 1920 by 10 A.D. at 100 percent to get a sense of

03:15.640 --> 03:23.510
how it's going to look at full size and full resolution Well Rynders looking pretty good.

03:23.510 --> 03:28.910
We can see some reflections here in the metal of the paper towel holder.

03:28.910 --> 03:33.200
We can also see some of the texture on the paper towels and on the orange.

03:33.320 --> 03:40.910
Now we still see some grain appear in the shadows and down here under the bowl and that can often be

03:40.910 --> 03:44.150
remedied by just increasing the samples.

03:44.150 --> 03:47.180
Let me zoom out a bit here.

03:47.180 --> 03:55.100
Just increasing the samples in the render window under sampling here.

03:55.100 --> 04:01.860
So currently we only have 100 samples for the render and it doesn't look too bad.

04:01.880 --> 04:07.450
The problem is that it's taken us almost four minutes to render this one frame.

04:07.880 --> 04:14.820
And if it is a single frame image that you're going to use that may not be a problem if it's an animation.

04:14.870 --> 04:22.240
And as I've said if you have hundreds or thousands of frames maybe four minutes of frame is not acceptable.

04:22.640 --> 04:25.770
This is all very much a balancing act.

04:25.820 --> 04:32.070
How much quality do you want to get balanced with how much time you have to render.

04:33.250 --> 04:42.160
So to clean up some of the grain in the shadows here we could turn up our sampling to 200 500 1000 but

04:42.190 --> 04:47.290
any increase in our samples will also increase the render time.

04:47.300 --> 04:55.200
Now if you have reflective objects like this paper towel holder you can see here right in here there

04:55.310 --> 05:03.070
are these little Firefly's little sparklies that happen because of the reflections coming off the material.

05:03.400 --> 05:05.970
Now these may be acceptable.

05:05.980 --> 05:12.590
However if you are interested in trying to reduce those there are a couple of things that you can do.

05:12.670 --> 05:20.200
First of all since we have an HDR image in the background or being used for reflections and lighting

05:20.440 --> 05:28.090
we may need to come back to our world settings here and under settings we could turn on this multiple

05:28.090 --> 05:29.820
importance setting.

05:29.950 --> 05:36.970
I'll just click that there and you can see here it says use multiple important sampling for the environment

05:37.540 --> 05:41.750
and that can help clean up some of those Firefly's.

05:41.860 --> 05:43.230
That's one thing to try.

05:43.660 --> 05:53.650
Another over here in the render panel and under light paths you have a filter glossy setting if you

05:53.650 --> 06:01.500
increase this just a bit it can help filter some of the artifacts we're getting from that glossy node.

06:01.810 --> 06:09.400
And in addition we could turn off caustic completely here under refractive and reflective caustic caustic

06:09.430 --> 06:16.150
are the light patterns that can happen when light bounces off or through an object.

06:16.150 --> 06:21.550
We can turn these off completely and reduce some of that Firefly effect.

06:21.550 --> 06:23.910
But Cossack's are kind of nice.

06:24.040 --> 06:29.790
So you may want to give it a try to see if you can get the effects that you're looking for.

06:30.220 --> 06:36.190
And lastly if need be you can come up here and adjust the clamp indirect setting.

06:36.220 --> 06:42.730
This will clamp the high end or the brightest parts of the scene and so it can actually reduce some

06:42.730 --> 06:45.670
of the quality or the highlights in your scene.

06:45.670 --> 06:51.220
If I took this and maybe entered 10 let's say and tried that.

06:51.220 --> 06:57.460
That may be able to get rid of some of those fireflies but it also may reduce the brightness or the

06:57.460 --> 07:01.800
highlights in my scene but we'll give it a shot and see how it looks.

07:01.810 --> 07:02.080
All right.

07:02.080 --> 07:05.580
So I'm going to scroll back up and let's render again.

07:07.030 --> 07:09.610
Well our image has rendered and it's looking pretty good.

07:09.790 --> 07:13.160
I've increased the samples up to 500.

07:13.240 --> 07:17.990
And you can see because of that the render time is over 20 minutes.

07:18.190 --> 07:26.020
But in addition the few settings we changed has really helped eliminate those fireflies coming off of

07:26.020 --> 07:27.680
our reflective surfaces.

07:28.090 --> 07:33.460
So now that we have our render the way we want it we can go ahead and save it out by coming down here

07:33.460 --> 07:41.220
to the image menu and we can click save image and save it out to wherever we want.

07:41.230 --> 07:44.140
Maybe I'll call this render one.

07:44.140 --> 07:52.660
Maybe I'll want to test different lighting scenarios different colors materials etc. so I'll just save

07:52.660 --> 07:53.550
that out.

07:53.710 --> 08:00.770
And now I have my rendered image Well thank you for watching this materials and lighting course.

08:00.770 --> 08:02.340
I hope it's been helpful.

08:02.390 --> 08:07.030
Please check out the other great courses we have here at Blendr 101 dot com.

08:07.130 --> 08:08.450
So thanks again.

08:08.450 --> 08:10.710
I'll see you next time and take care.
