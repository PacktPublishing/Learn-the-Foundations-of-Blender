00:00.810 --> 00:06.120
Well have gone through and added some materials to the rest of the objects in the scene and it looks

00:06.120 --> 00:07.010
pretty good.

00:07.260 --> 00:13.860
But if we look here at the metal of the paper towel holder we can see that the reflections of it are

00:13.860 --> 00:17.780
kind of blurred or they're not very interesting.

00:17.820 --> 00:24.610
In other words we're not getting a reflection of what the room might look like outside of the frame.

00:24.750 --> 00:29.450
And the reason for that is because there isn't really anything outside the frame at all.

00:29.640 --> 00:37.980
If we come down here and choose rendered viewport shading in this view we can see that everything outside

00:37.980 --> 00:43.620
our frame is pretty much black and that's because early on if you remember we came over here to the

00:43.620 --> 00:48.570
world panel and we changed our color at Horizon to black.

00:48.720 --> 00:52.590
So there wasn't any ambient light bleeding into our scene.

00:52.650 --> 00:56.570
We wanted to use just the lights that we were creating.

00:56.610 --> 00:59.930
However there's another way to light your scene.

01:00.000 --> 01:07.230
We can use what's called HDR images or high dynamic range images and we can put one of those images

01:07.500 --> 01:13.330
back here in the environment have the light from the image light are seen.

01:13.380 --> 01:19.880
But more importantly I think have something to reflect in our metallic objects.

01:20.100 --> 01:29.310
Metal is oftentimes very hard to set up because so much of it relies on what is being reflected rather

01:29.310 --> 01:31.350
than the material itself.

01:31.350 --> 01:39.360
So if we wanted to add an HDR image to our scene here we would do it here in the world panel or over

01:39.360 --> 01:41.000
here in the node editor.

01:41.010 --> 01:46.180
So I can come over here and change to the world nodes for our node Ed..

01:46.200 --> 01:50.970
But as you can see there isn't anything here we don't have use nodes checked.

01:51.270 --> 01:58.920
And this use node's button is here we just need to click on this and now we can see our nodes and you

01:58.920 --> 02:02.560
see here that use nodes has been selected.

02:02.580 --> 02:07.860
Now what we can do is bring in an HDR image as an environment texture.

02:07.890 --> 02:15.360
So let's go ahead and press shift A and I'll choose texture and environment.

02:15.360 --> 02:19.560
And now we need to open it here and bring in an HDR image.

02:19.560 --> 02:30.240
Now I've gone ahead and searched google images and found an image of a kitchen here right here and if

02:30.240 --> 02:39.010
I click open image and then connect the node up to the background here you can see that in our background

02:39.010 --> 02:41.170
we now have this image.

02:41.200 --> 02:49.740
And I can tumble around in here and you can see the whole thing.

02:50.010 --> 02:59.730
So now we have both light and reflection coming from this image and you can see the change in our render

02:59.730 --> 03:00.720
over here.

03:01.200 --> 03:10.290
So actually let me change this to solid and I'll go ahead and increase the size of this.

03:10.560 --> 03:16.080
I'll hit the zero key to switch to camera view and let's zoom in a bit here.

03:17.820 --> 03:24.210
So that image has brightened up our scene a bit and we can of course adjust the lights to get the image

03:24.210 --> 03:25.460
the way we want it.

03:25.470 --> 03:35.040
We can also adjust the background strength here if we want to reduce the effect of the HDR image.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.470
We can always do that as well.

03:37.470 --> 03:41.700
I'll just type in one again here to the background strength.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.670
Now let's take a look at this paper towel holder.

03:44.780 --> 03:47.360
I'll selected and frame it up.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.530
I'll switch back over to the object nodes.

03:50.790 --> 03:54.130
Here's our nodes for the paper towel material.

03:54.210 --> 03:58.700
Come over here to the materials panel and switch over to the metal.

03:59.160 --> 04:05.220
And now if we take a look at this I'm going to zoom in and let's play with the settings of our material

04:05.220 --> 04:08.810
and see if we can get the reflection from our image in here.

04:08.820 --> 04:18.120
So if I take the glossy down to zero you can immediately see the reflection of our HDR image in the

04:18.120 --> 04:19.710
metal material.

04:19.710 --> 04:23.540
So now I think we get a better sense of what that metal can look like.

04:23.580 --> 04:30.450
Maybe I'll take the roughness back to point 1 let's see about that and maybe I'll take the mix Shater

04:30.450 --> 04:33.660
up two point seven.

04:33.720 --> 04:37.440
So we get a little bit more of the shine in there.

04:37.440 --> 04:39.360
Maybe I'll take it down to point 0 5.

04:39.360 --> 04:44.400
Let's try that every go so I think now we're getting a little bit more of the reflections that I really

04:44.400 --> 04:48.360
would want to have from that particular material.

04:48.360 --> 04:54.030
All right I'm going to hit zero again to go back to the camera of you now while we're here.

04:54.030 --> 05:01.560
I wanted to point out another possible material that we could use for say the ball in the scene.

05:01.560 --> 05:02.600
I'm going to select that.

05:02.610 --> 05:06.720
And here we have a diffuse Shater and a glossy.

05:06.810 --> 05:11.920
Over here you can see the diffuse and the glossy in the materials panel as well.

05:12.000 --> 05:19.570
We could maybe change this to just to see how it's going to look to say a glass shader.

05:19.770 --> 05:22.070
And let's see how that looks.

05:22.080 --> 05:28.190
I'm going to go ahead and zoom into it and tumble around to get a better look at it.

05:28.440 --> 05:30.990
Well right now it's not looking too good.

05:30.990 --> 05:37.360
We have our glass and we have a glossy but sometimes those two don't work well together.

05:37.410 --> 05:43.220
Let's take the factor in the mix Shater all the way down.

05:43.590 --> 05:48.890
And then I will reduce the color in our glass here.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.850
Something like that.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.120
So now we're beginning to see through that glass.

05:56.120 --> 06:04.630
Now maybe I'll bring the roughness down 2.1 and then bring the factor back up to maybe point two and

06:04.640 --> 06:07.080
let's see what happens here.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.890
So now we have a glass bowl with a bit of reflection in it.

06:10.940 --> 06:19.680
You can see the fruit reflected in it and you can also see through the bowl a bit to the fruit inside.

06:19.960 --> 06:27.250
So that glass shaker does a very good job of very quickly giving you a nice glass material.

06:27.250 --> 06:38.170
Now the I.O. are setting here is an actual real world setting a number that describes how light moves

06:38.170 --> 06:39.990
through a particular object.

06:40.000 --> 06:47.140
So I've come to Wikipedia here and I'm going to scroll down and you can see here that we've got real

06:47.140 --> 06:58.660
world IO our indices of refraction for say light soda lime glass is 1.4 six crown glass is 1.5 to water

06:58.780 --> 07:00.050
1.3.

07:00.070 --> 07:09.190
So these are real world settings that can help your materials react like and look like real world materials.

07:09.190 --> 07:19.070
So if we come back to Blendr here this IO are is 1.4 5 which is a very standard index for glass.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.360
So this is just a good starting point.

07:21.370 --> 07:29.260
If this were ice or water or anything else you could begin adjusting this Iowa bar to get it to look

07:29.260 --> 07:32.170
like that particular material.

07:32.170 --> 07:37.610
So in the next video I want to talk about one more shade or node that we haven't dealt with yet.

07:37.630 --> 07:39.400
The emission Shater.

07:39.640 --> 07:44.350
And also let's talk about a few things that we can do to clean up our renderers.

07:44.350 --> 07:52.240
You can see that we've got some grain here and some little fireflies going on around the reflective

07:52.240 --> 07:53.290
objects.

07:53.290 --> 07:55.720
Let's take a look at how we might clean those up.
